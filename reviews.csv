August 2022,50,One of the highlights of our trip!,"What a wonderful evening we recently spent with Martine and Olav!

We learned so many interesting things about Amsterdam as well as personal stories from Martine and Olav. We were even lucky enough to hear some of their music. We enjoyed great food and conversation.

August 2022,50,Felt like a family dinner with a French chef hosting. Olaf and Martine hosted our group of six (3 couples).,"After a Baltic cruise we (3 couples) decided to visit Amsterdam. The highlight was our home cooked meal hosted by Martine and her husband Olaf at their home in Old Amsterdam. Lovely couple who welcomed us warmly. The food (French cuisine) was wonderfully cooked and presented. The conversation was easily flowing as we learned more about them and vice versa.    After eating on the ship and restaurants in Amsterdam, it was fantastic to have a home cooked meal. And to do it in a real Dutch home was the icing on a pretty great cake."
August 2022,50,Amazing Dutch Hospitality,"My wife and i were visiting Amsterdam prior to a cruise. as we were here back in 2014, and saw all the typical sites, i was looking for something different and more personnel. Martine, and her husband Olav showed up in trip advisor under a section related to eating at a locals house. that was the something different i was looking for. before i booked, I read the reviews, and started the booking through Trip Advisor. it took me to a webpage Eatwith where i made the reservation and the payment. Martine, then contacted me through the website (Very user friendly). she asked about any food allergies.    We arrived at their home overlooking a very old cannel. we were joined by two other couples. As both Martine, and Olav are chef's they shared the cooking. while the food was amazing, the hosts made the evening. they were both so warm and friendly, with great stories. The 3 hours flew by.    as for the food, one of the best meals i have ever eaten. It started with a toast of an old Dutch liqueur, then came the appetizers, including a mushroom ragout tart, cheese paired with pickled ginger, an amazing deviled egg and a local sausage. This was paired with a nice white wine. Then came a wonderful salad with shredded smoked mackerel. The main course, was a ground up pork sausage wrapped in bacon, with two types of mashed potatoes. one was made with bacon bits, and endive. the other with carrots, and grilled onions. both were so good, we all asked for the recipe. this was paired with a nice red wine. desert was a French toast made with a special local bread. It included, a homemade berry compote, and a special yogurt.    In addition to the Dutch meal, they also have a French meal option.    As a side, Olav is a local tour guide. we hired him for a wonderful localized tour in the AM. lots of insite that you don't usually get."
August 2022,50,Amsterdam Dinner and birthday celebration,Martine and Ulav provided a wonderful dinner experience that will not be forgotten. The simple but delectable fare started with a selection of appetizers paired with a lovely white wine and then advanced to a wonderful meal and dessert. The laughter was contagious and the sharing of music afterward made us feel at home... This is definitely a treat when in Amsterdam that I hope to experience again and would strongly recommend!!

July 2022,50,A Special Amsterdam Dinner,What a wonderful evening at Martine’s Table. Olaf and Martine made us very welcome in their home. The food was delicious and the presentation exquisite. We shared the table with another couple along with Martine and Olaf. Great conversation in a relaxing atmosphere. Highly recommend for a different eating out experience.
June 2022,50,Wonderful start to my Vacation,This was a truly wonderful experience. Not only did Martine and Olav present a gourmet meal with wine they also led a wonderful discussion of their experiences. They discussed how they came to live where they do and what other things they had tried doing before running a restaurant for many years. They tried retiring before deciding to invite a small number of people to eat at their home once or twice a week. They discussed what the others in our small group of people might be interested in doing during their visit or anything that someone wanted to discuss.    Remember to check their site for when your chance may come to join them for an evening of food and discussion.    Extremely reasonable price for everything.
June 2022,50,A Memorable Experience,"We had a lovely dinner with Martine & Olav last week. The dinner was delicious and the conversation was enlightening. I learned more about Amsterdam, the people, and the attractions of the city. Martine took pictures and sent them to us. I love the pictures and it is absolutely a memorable experience. It was so nice of Martine to accompany us back to the hotel. I enjoyed the conversation and time together with both. Nancy Biddle"
