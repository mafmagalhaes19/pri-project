d11752080,April 2022,50,The first dinner with family after arrival at Amsterdam,Our family enjoyed a warm dinner at Martine's home after our first arrival at Amsterdam. The food was amazing and the wine was good too. We will book Martine of Martine's Table when we visit Amsterdam again.
d11752080,December 2021,50,Excellent Dining Experience,"Excellent Amsterdam dining experience! Highly recommend especially if you want to eat good food with a local chef in their home with other diners. The hosts were affable, great conversationalists and the meal was excellent, which included several courses with choices, dessert, beverages including wines&apéritifs. 4 couples & hosts couple made a great dinner for 10. Late posting this experience took place April 2019"
d11752080,August 2022,50,A Very Special Evening,"We enjoyed an excellent meal, interesting conversations, great wine selections, a special treat of Genever, as well as some fascinating personal stories that Olav and Martine shared with us. If you are visiting Amsterdam and want a personal experience in a lovely home with fantastic food, then this is not to be missed. Highly recommend."
d11752080,August 2022,50,One of the highlights of our trip!,"What a wonderful evening we recently spent with Martine and Olav! They were so welcoming and did a wonderful job hosting us in their home, alternating between cooking and conversing with us. We learned so many interesting things about Amsterdam as well as personal stories from Martine and Olav. We were even lucky enough to hear some of their music. We enjoyed great food and conversation. The evening was definitely one of the highlights of our trip! Many thanks to Martine and Olav for hosting us and creating such a special experience!"
d11752080,August 2022,50,Felt like a family dinner with a French chef hosting. Olaf and Martine hosted our group of six (3 couples).,"After a Baltic cruise we (3 couples) decided to visit Amsterdam. The highlight was our home cooked meal hosted by Martine and her husband Olaf at their home in Old Amsterdam. Lovely couple who welcomed us warmly. The food (French cuisine) was wonderfully cooked and presented. The conversation was easily flowing as we learned more about them and vice versa.    After eating on the ship and restaurants in Amsterdam, it was fantastic to have a home cooked meal. And to do it in a real Dutch home was the icing on a pretty great cake."
d11752080,August 2022,50,Amazing Dutch Hospitality,"My wife and i were visiting Amsterdam prior to a cruise. as we were here back in 2014, and saw all the typical sites, i was looking for something different and more personnel. Martine, and her husband Olav showed up in trip advisor under a section related to eating at a locals house. that was the something different i was looking for. before i booked, I read the reviews, and started the booking through Trip Advisor. it took me to a webpage Eatwith where i made the reservation and the payment. Martine, then contacted me through the website (Very user friendly). she asked about any food allergies.    We arrived at their home overlooking a very old cannel. we were joined by two other couples. As both Martine, and Olav are chef's they shared the cooking. while the food was amazing, the hosts made the evening. they were both so warm and friendly, with great stories. The 3 hours flew by.    as for the food, one of the best meals i have ever eaten. It started with a toast of an old Dutch liqueur, then came the appetizers, including a mushroom ragout tart, cheese paired with pickled ginger, an amazing deviled egg and a local sausage. This was paired with a nice white wine. Then came a wonderful salad with shredded smoked mackerel. The main course, was a ground up pork sausage wrapped in bacon, with two types of mashed potatoes. one was made with bacon bits, and endive. the other with carrots, and grilled onions. both were so good, we all asked for the recipe. this was paired with a nice red wine. desert was a French toast made with a special local bread. It included, a homemade berry compote, and a special yogurt.    In addition to the Dutch meal, they also have a French meal option.    As a side, Olav is a local tour guide. we hired him for a wonderful localized tour in the AM. lots of insite that you don't usually get."
d11752080,August 2022,50,Amsterdam Dinner and birthday celebration,Martine and Ulav provided a wonderful dinner experience that will not be forgotten. The simple but delectable fare started with a selection of appetizers paired with a lovely white wine and then advanced to a wonderful meal and dessert. The laughter was contagious and the sharing of music afterward made us feel at home... This is definitely a treat when in Amsterdam that I hope to experience again and would strongly recommend!!
d11752080,July 2022,50,Wonderful,"Great dinner, with wonderful hosts. The food was the best dinner we had on our three days in Amsterdam. We were four adults and there were two others who added to our great conversation at the table."
d11752080,July 2022,50,Pure joy!,"We had an amazing evening with Martine and Olav! Such great hosts and interesting persons! We spent few hours in a relaxing, cozy and friendly atmosphere. Telling stories and listening to them while enjoying absolutely fantastic dishes."
d11752080,July 2022,50,A wonderful delight,What a wonderful experience! Both the food and the company were beyond compare. We joined two additional couples along with Martine and Olav and enjoyed pleasant conversation re: culture and personal views about several issues. One couple was from the US and the other from Denmark. It was interesting to see how close in thoughts we were :-). It was a great experience meeting new people and making new friends!
d11752080,July 2022,50,A Special Amsterdam Dinner,What a wonderful evening at Martine’s Table. Olaf and Martine made us very welcome in their home. The food was delicious and the presentation exquisite. We shared the table with another couple along with Martine and Olaf. Great conversation in a relaxing atmosphere. Highly recommend for a different eating out experience.
d11752080,June 2022,50,Wonderful start to my Vacation,This was a truly wonderful experience. Not only did Martine and Olav present a gourmet meal with wine they also led a wonderful discussion of their experiences. They discussed how they came to live where they do and what other things they had tried doing before running a restaurant for many years. They tried retiring before deciding to invite a small number of people to eat at their home once or twice a week. They discussed what the others in our small group of people might be interested in doing during their visit or anything that someone wanted to discuss.    Remember to check their site for when your chance may come to join them for an evening of food and discussion.    Extremely reasonable price for everything.
d11752080,June 2022,50,A Memorable Experience,"We had a lovely dinner with Martine & Olav last week. The dinner was delicious and the conversation was enlightening. I learned more about Amsterdam, the people, and the attractions of the city. Martine took pictures and sent them to us. I love the pictures and it is absolutely a memorable experience. It was so nice of Martine to accompany us back to the hotel. I enjoyed the conversation and time together with both. Nancy Biddle"
d11752080,June 2022,50,A great night meeting new people and eating delicious food!,Thank you for the wonderful experience Martine and Olav! My mom and I had a wonderful time meeting new people and learning about Martine and Olav’s life as well. They put so much love and care into what they serve and we were so thankful to be a part of such a fun and unique experience. Highly recommend!
d11752080,June 2022,50,A fabulous evening,"Great food, great company. An excellent evening had by all. Martine and Olav were perfect hosts and made us feel very welcome. Fascinating insights into Amsterdam from a couple who have lived there for forty years."
d693419,October 2022,50,Very nice experience,"We booked this place some months ago, based on the recommendations.  And these were well deserved.  Very friendly and funny staff, that greeted us, before we entered.  Serving, story about the place and most importantly food and wine where excellent.  We had the ""Silver & Golden Spiegel Michelin Special"", and it was the right decision.  We definitely can recommend a visit here."
d693419,April 2022,50,De Silveren Spiegel is a must stop. 5/5.,One word ‘WOW.’ De Silveren Spiegel is a must stop if you are looking for that extra special something on your trip to Amsterdam. The best fine dining experience we have had anywhere in the world. The staff and food were amazing.
d693419,October 2022,50,"Great dinner and friendly service from Harry ""porter""",Our first dinner in Amsterdam and its a michelin place! We were told by the wait staff that their chef is very young and talented. We tried the 8 course dinner without pairing. Take a look at the pics to have a better idea of the food and visuals. The place and ambience was just right. Well deserved 5 green dots.
d693419,September 2022,50,Fine dining must in Amsterdam,One of the best restaurants in the world.    This is five star establishment with a family restaurant feel that makes the experience very warm and unforgettable. The tasting menu is a must and the wine pairings are thoughtful and well presented.    The history of the dwelling and the family who runs the establishment make this a must visit for anyone looking for a high-end Dutch dining experience.
d693419,September 2022,50,"Last Night in Amsterdam, Netherlands.","Top to bottom, this place is more than worth it for that special occasion. We spent our last dinner in Amsterdam, and we experienced an explosion of favor. If you want a truly amazing dining experence, you DON'T want to miss this restaurant!!!"
d693419,September 2022,50,First night dinner set the bar for the rest of the trip.,"Hardworking, friendly unpretentious staff. Beautifully presented, outstandingly delicious 6 course meal. Only thing left to say is Bravo!"
d693419,September 2022,50,Excellent service and fare,This is an excellent restaurant in all ways. The staff and service is unpretencious and informative. The food is of excellent quality and maintains that quality through all the courses. The wine selection is also of good value and quality. Everything you could want for a good high quality mral.
d693419,September 2022,50,Incredible experience!,"Delicious food complimented perfectly with lovely wines and fantastic service, especially Harry. It was a really special evening."
d693419,September 2022,50,Last Day of Viking cruise,"What an Amazing Restaurant. This was suggested by Viking as it has a Michelin Star. Well i have to say we were not disappointed. We did the 8 courses with the wine pairing. Each time we finished a course I thought well that was the best one, and it will be hard to top it. Then the next one came out it was even better. All I can say is FANTASTIC."
d693419,September 2022,50,Welcoming Restaurant,"This was an amazing restaurant. Without knowing much about the place beforehand, I was a little worried that it might be too formal and stuffy for my tastes but I was happily surprised at how warm and welcoming everyone was. The food was amazing and the service faultless. Lovely people running a top class restaurant, superb."
d693419,September 2022,50,Best food experience ever!,"Genuinely the best experience with food I’ve ever had. Every single dish was perfectly executed and each flavour exploded in your mouth. The wine pairings were amazing and matched the food perfectly. We come to Amsterdam twice per year and this is now on our itinerary for the future, a real gem."
d693419,September 2022,50,Five stars,Food superb. Service excellent  A great choice for our birthday celebration. I would highly recommend this restaurant for top notch food.
d693419,September 2022,50,The pride of the finest craftsmanship,"This is a recently quite rare case when there's no corporation, no big-name hotel, no celebrity 'umbrella"" brand - nothing stands behind this restaurant. Nothing but full-hearted devotion of a small family and a handful of employees that care just as deeply. They all have to rely only on one old-fashioned rule - make the customers happy so that they would want to come back. No shortcuts, no ""make immediate profit"" - make a customer for life.    There has been a lot of comments here how unfair it is that this restaurant does not have a Michelin star or two that they absolutely deserve. We are still puzzled as we frequent many Michelin restaurants in different parts of the world, and this is a solid 2-stars in our opinion.    We have been dining here for a number of years, watching the chef evolve and grow his skills. We always liked the concept, but in all honesty, we can remember that in the past years some courses were just a little underwhelming. Not anymore. Every single one of the 8-course tasting menu was a wow. It starts with painstakingly detailed presentation - every plate comes as a piece of art, and I guarantee you will take a minute just admiring as you will feel guilty to ruin it. The creativity, the taste, the textures, the freshness of ingredients and the many, many multiple flavors will make you pause after every bite. This is our favorite feature of the chef's signature style - the dish comes as a combination of multiple single bites around the ""main player"" of the course that are designed to work together and complement each other - you will not be bored. The guy is seriously in competition with his former self, steadily true to his concept of dining over the years but trying to outdo himself and kick it another notch with every new menu. At this point, with every single course being so memorably amazing, we feel like he reached his peak.    Please choose the wine paring. We know it can be hit and miss sometimes with tasting menus in different restaurants, but we never had a bad wine here. Also, it's not on the menu, so I'm not sure if you can ask for this, but if the host/sommelier ever offers you a premium wine paring - do not hesitate for a minute. The wines will be above and beyond, rare and carefully selected. It's absolutely worth paying extra and will be something really memorable.    The service and the ambience match the experience. The house is so beautiful, and the atmosphere is so warm and friendly, it's hard to believe that all the work is done just by a handful of people. And that brings me to my starting point - it can only be done when those people are so passionate and devoted to their craft that they ""live and breathe"" this restaurant. It's their life and it shines through every little detail. It deserves every praise and earns them the right to be really proud of their creation.    Thank you, we had another three amazing nights during our last trip, and we are already counting days until we can do this again!"
d693419,September 2022,40,An excellent dinner,The restaurant is in a 200 year old building. All serving staffs were friendly and took the time to explain each dish and wine. The quality and presentation were excellent. It is value for money dinner. I would recommend a should try when in Amsterdam.
d693419,August 2022,40,"Tastes great, but too slow","We had the 7 course menu and the food was delightful, as were the waiters.  We don't like mussels and this course was cheerfully swapped to something else.    Not sure if it's still because of covid, but the 7 courses( which are small, but very tasty, so many flavours ..) took 3 hours, which is way too long. The dishes came at regular intervals, but with too long a gap in between. We didn't get our main dish till after 2.5 hours at 10pm. By this time we were tired and uncomfortable in our seats which meant we didn't appreciate the food as much as it deserved .  This was worse as my partner had an uneven floor on a downhill slope for hers.    If the pace could be lifted, ,5 stars would have been given and we wouldn't have paid much attention to the seats."
d1239229,October 2022,50,#1,"How anyone could only give this georgous restaurant 5 stars is beyond me. Because it should have 500 stars. From the second you are seated, you know you are off on an experience. Endless courses of culinary perfection are transported from farm to table with military precision. Each course served on or in a unique plate, bowl or marble pedistal. Each dish has flavours exploding on your palette. At the end of the evening, the chef comes out from under his staircase layer to greet his guests. Like an old friend, he has communicated his vocabulary with food. This is hands down, one of the top 3 meals of my life. Oh, change that, make it the #1!!"
d1239229,September 2022,50,Outstanding,"I have been lucky enough to eat in many of the world's best restaurants and our meal at Vinkeles was right up there. Classical with a Japanese twist, and very, very well executed.    Great value for money when you think about the work that has gone in to preparing the food (and the idea of doing the wine flight in half glasses is great one that others could learn from)."
d1239229,September 2022,50,Fantastic food and excellent service,"A stunning set of innovative dishes, accompanied by excellent service in a great environment. One of the best, if not the best, restaurants we have visited. Not cheap, but the quality matches the price."
d1239229,June 2022,50,Definitely 2 stars on its way,"Our second visit to this restaurant and we wondered again, how come that this restaurant hasn’t earned its 2nd Michelin star yet !  The venue is super beautiful and luxurious, the staff and service are impeccable.  The food is out of this world where we enjoyed every single bite and dish  Vinkeles is all about art, excellence and dedication to ingredients and creativity  Can wait for our next visit"
d1239229,May 2022,10,Birthday disaster,"I booked a table for 8 to celebrate my birthday with my family visiting from abroad. I got the attached email confirming my reservation and asking me to please arrive on time. When we arrived with the whole group there was no reservation. The manager came out and tried to argue that the email I received saying my reservation was confirmed, was in reality not a final reservation, and that she could see on her system that someone had contacted me. Unfortunately no one did. Not a single email or phone call. A Michelin star should be way more than what happens in the kitchen. It’s about service and customer experience. This restaurant definitely does not deserve a star. Thank you for ruining my 45th birthday dinner."
d1239229,December 2021,50,Excellent execution,"Due to the lockdown in Amsterdam, our original dinner reservation of 7pm became 5pm, and then eventually a late lunch at 1.30pm. The restaurant handled these developments very well and kept us updated all the way.  The food was how we remembered it to be, well executed and special mention to the pigeon dish that was as tender and delicious as it was when we had it years ago. The food and wine pairing offered excellent value and I would strongly recommend the diner partakes in this. Service was warm without being intrusive; we left happy and full and will definitely be back the next time we pass through Amsterdam."
d1239229,October 2021,20,Disappointing dinner,"Considering that we are talking about a 1 star restaurant, we had a really disappointing experience.  Main problem, our table was outside the main room, close to the stairs/exit, with the waiters turning their backs on us and continuously passing by our table talking and coordinating.  We made the reservation 2 months before, so this was non acceptable.  When we told them about the uncomfortable situation they replied telling us that one was one of the best tables, far from the noise. Not acceptable at all as an answer, apologies would have been better.  The service for a 1 star was below the average, a waiter made funny comments on our empty plates 3 times, again not acceptable.  Food: few great dishes and many other really even not sufficient...on average a lot below expectations.  Would I suggest this restaurant? Not at all, in Amsterdam there are 1 star restaurants much better than this one."
d1239229,September 2021,50,Fantastic!,"Absolutely delicious, creative food and they catered thoughtfully for my no fish/seafood requirements. The room is beautiful - I think it is an old bakery and some of the features have been preserved. Definitely a place for a special occasion and a memorable meal. I will definitely go back!"
d1239229,September 2021,50,Excellent food and wine pairing,This was our second visit to Vinkeles and wanted to see if its still as good as 4 years ago. We were blown away again. 3 amuses and 6 courses - all very nice and flavorful.    We liked the first 2 courses the most - the wine pairing was 101% on the spot there.  The sommelier explains each wine in detail without rushing it.    Vinkeles compares very favorably against other 1-star places we have dined in.
d1239229,September 2021,50,Elegant atmosphere and delicious menu,"We had the opportunity to be at restaurant Vinkeles for a 6 gang menu experience. The plates served by the chef and its team were simply delicious , the service excellent, the stuff friendly and the atmosphere unique.    We are highly recommending to book a table the next time you visit Amsterdam."
d1239229,December 2020,50,Awesome experience,"We had the 7 course chef's menu yesterday and we had an awesome evening. Really knowledgeable staff, superfriendly and great service. The dishes were well balanced and exciting. Great local produce too! Wine pairing was spot on! Really an evening to remember!"
d1239229,July 2020,50,Interesting and elegant,At the level we expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant. The menu is daring and Asian-inspired. Could be a bit too eclectic for a classic palate though.
d1239229,December 2019,50,Perfect for our last night,"The venue is beautiful, warm and elegant at the same time, staff is polite, helpful and not intruding. Modern cuisine with a wild flair, tasting menu rich of flavors, it was such a delight to end our trip at this amazing restaurant"
d1239229,February 2020,50,Fantastic venue,We have just celebrated my wife’s birthday at Vinkeles and had a lovely evening. The staff were very welcoming and attended to us with friendliness without being overbearing. The food was fantastic and the dish combinations were inspired - I would never have considered serving chocolate with paté! The wine choice was varied and complemented the food well. I would definitely recommend.
d1239229,December 2019,40,Amazing and fancy danish food,"I had an amazing experience in Vinkeles, tasting a modern interpretation of Viking gastronomy. The restaurant itself is a beautiful place, full of style and elegance."
d6864170,May 2022,50,"Possibly the best restaurant in Amsterdam, extremely creative","Located in an obviously posh setting but with laidback service and atmosphere, spectrum will either blow you away or leave you dissapointed. The flavors are bold, refined and outspoken however some dishes are fairly experimental, which will be experienced differently by people. It is the only restaurant of this caliber where I've seen dishes being sent back by guests, which might also be a product of it being in a posh hotel where guests just have their dinner there instead of making a trip out there to eat.    The staff was laid back and knowledgable, making this visit an interesting and pleasant experience."
d6864170,June 2022,50,A marvelous experience,"I visited this restaurant with my partner for our 3-years anniversary.    This restaurant is, quite literally, a hidden gem. Indeed, it is nested deep into the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. From the very beginning when the hostess will greet you at the door you will feel warmly welcomed.    The service is without hesitation the very best service I have experienced among all the Michelin starred restaurants I have been to, surpassing even 3-stars rated establishments. The staff is caring, extremely precise and polite without being invasive. We had a couple of wonderful chats with Cas, the sommelier, who gave us very interesting insights about the wines served in the pairing.    The atmosphere is intimate yet very luminous, with the Amsterdam summer light infusing through the large windows until quite late in the evening (this was on June 18th). The inner garden of the Waldorf Astoria, in which we took a short walk to have a smoke, is also a very nice place.    The menu is very imaginative and every dish offers a unique, incredible and harmonious taste. My personal favorite was the blue lobster with duck tongue, foie gras and green apple juice, probably among the best dishes I have ever had the chance to experience in my life.    The wine pairing was exquisite, the wines are quite unique and a lot of research has been done to find the pairings. one of which was next to impossible: the lamb with oyster and asparagus dish pairing was spot-on, featuring a red wine which had both the structure to accompany the lamb and the lightness to preserve the oyster's finesse. I want to especially thank and compliment the sommelier who told us wonderful stories about the wines served.    In order not to spoil the surprise for future guests I will only say that there is a little something after the dessert which is really interesting.    Overall: an oustanding experience, I'd like to warmly thank the whole team at Spectrum for such an excellent evening and experience. Will definitely come back next time I will be visiting Amsterdam."
d6864170,June 2022,30,Too experimental,"With all this good reviews, I have to say it might be too complex for me to understand the food in this restaurant , maybe it’s far more advanced to my taste buds to grasp , I don’t know ! I dined in 3 and 2 Michelin stars all around the world and it’s by far the most irritating and disappointing experience I have had in a Michelin star establishment despite impeccable service and superb wine.    Every single dish was very promising until this weird experimental ingredient comes and ruins the dish for us, too much ingredients and complexity but without giving the ultimate taste or amusement to our taste buds .. every single dish had something off in it, I know how dedicated the chef and the staff are, but unfortunately this what we all 4 felt    Wine was exceptional, although sommelier forgot to explain for us the last two wines for our lamb and duck    My analysis is that this restaurant is too bold and experimental but they overdo it in the kitchen and with the choice of weird ingredients that didn’t pull it off    Watermelon pistachio and horse reddish  Mackerel with black pudding  Shrimps with short ribs and water melon and ginger  Fish with beetroot  Truffle with apricot  Duck pomegranate and black olives  Lobster and green apple sauce  There much better places to eat in Amsterdam, but again the service and the staff were imoacdable"
d6864170,May 2022,40,The best dining in Amsterdam,"The quality is about the same as four years ago, maybe not quite as inventive. The staff makes a certain round in the restaurant to inspect the tables. They could be less obvious about it. There are some oddities in the wine pairing."
d6864170,March 2022,50,Heaven on earth,Wow. It was special evening. We found the best restaurant experience on the world in Spectrum! Was there Picasso and Van Gogh cooking? I saw and taste something unbelievable and I would give to this place 3 Michelin stars any given sunday. Respect and thank you♥️
d6864170,May 2021,50,Simply the best in the Netherlands,"Just one comment. How do you make a desert with strawberries, sling beans and dille and make it the best desert ever tasted. Go to spectrum a two star that deserves to have three."
d6864170,January 2020,50,Possibly the Best Meal I've Ever Had!,"This restaurant is absolutely fantastic. So much care is put into every detail resulting in some of the best food I've ever tasted.  We had the full fine dining experience, made up of 10 courses, so that we could enjoy this restaurant to its fullest potential. This consisted of 4 rounds of amuse bouches, 6 mains and 8 small desserts.⁣ The menu is a Dutch-East Asian fusion, with the duck especially being inspired by Chinese cuisine.  The dishes served up are fun and different, especially the desserts such as avocado sorbet (my favorite course) and a set of six chocolates that are flavoured like previous courses to remind you of them (how cool is that?!). ⁣Every detail has so much care put into it, even ranging to the homemade butter, which comes in 4 different flavors. Staff is professional, yet warm and friendly, tending to our every need.⁣ The restaurant truly leaves a great impression and a full stomach. Every aspect of our meal was fantastic and this may be the best meal I've ever had."
d6864170,November 2020,50,Great anniversary dinner experience,"We were celebrating our anniversary and what better way to do that than a great dinner at Spectrum and spending the night at the Waldorf Astoria afterwards. With the current Covid restrictions it’s the best way to make great memories. We appreciated the card signed by the Spectrum team.    We arrived late afternoon and were seated in the corner of the restaurant with a nice view of the garden. There are two choices in the menu, vegetarian and regular. My wife opted for the vegetarian option and me for the regular fish/meat one. Both options were great but especially the veggie version was excellent.    We opted for the wine pairing by sommelier Cas. He explained all the choices and we had different wines as we had different menu’s, so lot’s to discuss what we enjoyed. We would have appreciated a bit more red wines and after the dinner Cas brought us a nice round red to finish of the evening.    The dinners started with two great amuses followed by 7 courses, I appreciated the pidgin a lot and my wife watermelon. What we missed was a small pre desert and a sweet desert, I understand the chef isn’t a real sweet tooth but some (me) are. So my tip for the menu is to put a bit more effort at the end, the chocolates with flavors of the menu didn’t do that for us."
d6864170,October 2020,50,Amazing from end to end,The service is so gentle and so considerate. Wine advices are very originals. And of course the diner was amazing. Every plate had several textures and colors and tastes. Thank you so much for this dîner!!!
d6864170,July 2020,50,Best dining experience in years,"Signature dishes with combinations of flavours and ingredients that are truly novel and surprising. Wonderful stylish and relaxing ambiance. The talented restaurant team lead by Sascha makes you live in the moment and enjoy the wonderful experience while everything is taken care of. To summarize, a fantastic restaurant at a fantastic location with a wonderful team that leaves you with a one of a kind experience that we will probably remember for years to come. Looking forward to revisit somewhere in the future."
d6864170,March 2020,50,Fine dining at it’s finest.,"Sidney, Sascha and the masterful team at Spectrum have created a truly once in a lifetime experience (though I hope to return soon!) We had the vegetable tasting menu and it was clear that the vegetarian menu was just as considered as the meat menu. Delicious surprises at every turn in a meal I will never forget. I’d say more but you should just go and go hungry!"
d6864170,February 2020,20,"The service is great, BUT...","The service is great, but the food is so “creative” that is really hard to swallow.  I love trying new stuff. In every city we go, we try to make some reservations in the best restaurants available and this was not a good experience. We asked for the tasting menu and just two of the ten plates where enjoyable. We’ve been in many, many places and this so sophisticated “pigeon meat/octopus chocolate” restaurant wasn’t for us. We really tried to enjoy it, but it was not easy."
d6864170,February 2020,50,"Creative dishes, lovely staff","A great place to try out food combinations you never thought about (like chocolate & truffles ).  Very risky flavor combinations , for most of the dishes it worked out for them.  There was no choice of bread, but the bread that they serve was on spot.  We ordered 2 cocktails, both were fantastic.  The servers stand out, engaging in a fun conversation with us, and even allowing us a peak to the kitchen!"
d6864170,December 2019,50,Beyond My Wildest Expectations,"After an entire year of research, and much consideration, I booked our hotel stay at the Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam and also booked dinner reservations at Spectrum for our final evening. I could not be happier with this choice!    Our dining experience at Spectrum was more incredible than I can even begin to describe. As we walked through our hotel lobby, someone immediately asked to escort us to Spectrum and took our coats. We had a lovely table in the corner and were surrounded by beautiful artwork.    Service was absolute perfection. The servers were professional, but not stuffy, warm, welcoming, helpful, and a true delight. Sascha went out of his way to make my special early milestone birthday celebration, the dining experience of a lifetime. We have had the opportunity to dine at many phenomenal restaurants around the world, but our experience at Spectrum tops them all. Executive Chef, Sidney Schutte, is truly brilliant and creates a feast for the senses with each course. Food was not just a work of art, but also a taste sensation.    We opted for the 11 course tasting menu, and this truly is the only way to do it. My husband and I are both pescetarians and I have a mushroom allergy, but the chef did a beautiful job constructing a meal that was out of this world.    I am very grateful that I read the TripAdvisor reviews on Spectrum because this convinced me to book our special dinner.    If you are ever near Amsterdam, you should go out of your way to dine at Spectrum. It will be an extraordinary experience that you will never forget. Thank you Patrycja, Sidney, and Sascha for making our trip to Amsterdam spectacular. Of all tours, museums, and activities we did in Amsterdam, dining at Spectrum was our favorite."
d6864170,December 2019,50,By far the best restaurant,"By far the best restaurant in the Netherlands, better than the three stars. Inventive, beautiful presentations, great taste, very friendly and correct service."
d696902,September 2022,50,It's an experience,"Just exquisite. It was our third time and Ciel Blue keeps surprising us. The food is surprising, and service is just perfect. Despite most tables have the same menu the personnel provides a tailor-made approach and makes you feel special.More"
d696902,September 2022,50,Amazing...worth every penny!,"What an incredible meal! We choose the Caviar Menu and WOW, did we certainly get ample portions of caviar! We also did the wine pairing...so worth it. The staff was so attentive, every detail was perfection. A special thank you to Francesco, the service manager, he helped to make my birthday celebration so memorable. Our sommelier, Noel, was beyond knowledgable, he made our evening so much fun. The entire evening will always bring a smile to our faces. First time in Amsterdam and first time at Ciel Bleu - we will definitely be back! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
d696902,September 2022,50,What a great michelin experience !!!,"Its always great to come back to the Ciel Bleu Restaurant. The excellent cooking and exceptional cuisine is definitely worth the gastronomic journey. Niccolo Sommelier and Julian Chef de Rang, our hosts, were brilliant especially towards our daughter who was celebrating her 21st birthday. Thank you so much guys for another extraordinary night at Amsterdam !!!"
d696902,July 2022,30,"Great service, nice view, unremarkable food.","The staff and service was top notch, but the food was a bit dissapointing. Only one or two dishes brought smiles to our faces, but honestly we had a much better food experience at De Kas the night before. We splurged for the Wagyu beef upgrade, but the meat was a bit to fatty for our taste (top grade Korean Hanu beef tastes better, with much nice texture). We felt like the restaurant has become complacent with its food? Definitely not worth the 700 euro we spent. We reccomend finding up and coming restaurants vs coming to a place like this."
d696902,July 2022,30,meh - interesting but for us not really worth the time,"Take this review with a grain of salt in that we tend to prefer great, non-stuffy one star restaurants than fancy two and three stars - unless they are really special and worth the time, pomp and circumstance. This one we felt was not. Everyone was very nice and the service was generally good, though perhaps not quite as attentive or refined as you'd typically expect in a restaurant where they go to the trouble of having everyone wear white gloves and stamping the restaurant's name into the tablecloths etc. The room felt a little dated, like 1980's trying to be fancy. The views are probably as good as it gets in Amsterdam, but actually staring over lots of houses and industrial facilities, it wasn't as striking as we had imagined (e.g., can't really see the water). Maybe it would be nicer later in the evening, but it doesnt get dark until really late in the summertime.... Wasn't really clear what they were going for on the food in terms of style/cuisine, but it was generally ok but not particularly notable for its flavors or quality of ingredients. e.g., Caviar dish supplement was ok but not particularly memorable, the supplement Wagyu dish was ok but for 60 euro extra again not particularly memorable. The days of just paying a lot more for a ""fancy"" supplement without really doing something special/memorable with those dishes are over.... With each dish came an indicative spice that was presented in a wooden receptacle on the table to illustrate a flavor that was highlighted in the dish. That was interesting but felt a bit kitchy, particularly when the food didn't really stand on its own. wine list was ok but there were very few options between the 150Euro range and the 500+ Euro range, so if you wanted a relatively nice bottle you had to really lean in (which we did and it was nice, but not mind blowing). Felt like the experience all dragged on a bit. Anyhow this restaurant is clearly striving for a standard that perhaps doesnt really exist in Amsterdam, which I suppose is not really known for its elegant food - we much preferred the meals we had at lower key places like Zoldering (which was amazing - Better, more interesting food without all the stuffiness). But obviously plenty of people feel differently based on the reviews..."
d696902,June 2022,50,Exquisite,"The dining experience was magnificent, from the exquisite food, service and atmosphere. A truly unforgettable experience"
d696902,June 2022,50,Great night,"Ciel Bleu is for many years one of the best restaurants in the Netherlands (best of Amsterdam). The most tables have a great few over Amsterdam from the 23th floor. The staff is kind and very professional and the food, all courses were amazing!! Keep up the good work Ciel Bleu!! See you soon!!"
d696902,May 2022,50,Top level experience,"Staying at the Okura Hotel there is a wide choice to dine. With 2 Michelin stars Ciel Blue at the top level of the hotel is the most exclusive to visit.  As might be expected all courses are of high standards, presented by a dedicated staff.  The courses show a wide variety of flavors, expressed by a small wooden cabinet that’s being filled during the various courses with a spice used in a course.  A small touch to give an extra emphasis on every course; Elegant, interesting and educational at the same time.    The presented wines absolutely match the quality of the food presented. With a listening ear to the guests the staff present excellent wines to match the taste and expectations you are having.    Overall an experience not easily to forget, overlooking the city while the sun sets slowly."
d696902,May 2022,50,"Exceptional restaurant, knowledgeable waiters and a beautiful atmosphere with a view","My second visit to Ciel Bleu. Beautiful elegant atmosphere, A nice view over Amsterdam from the window tables and a top attentive, discrete service. The wine card is a bible for wine enthusiasts and the food was a festive act for the mouth and eye and absolutely exceptional. I can totally recommend this restaurant which was a close to perfect experience."
d696902,April 2022,50,"Best meal, wine and view in Amsterdam.","An amazing evening that was capped off by an amazing staff and then oh yea there is the food. I do not even know how to say how wonderful this restaurant is. From the moment you get off the elevator on the 23rd floor you are greeted with amazing etiquette from manners, personality and just utter politeness. As we were taken to our table (by the way I believe there are only 12 tables) you cannot help but be “awwed” by the beautiful decor, flowers and glass sculptures on the tables (which by the way we learned are for sale). As soon as you are seated by the most amazing man that shares his experience and knowledge of the wines and champagnes. I could keep going but I will tell you the 5-course meal is actually 12 different foods and every single one was better than the last. But those entrees were mouth watering. The lamb melted in your mouth and the wagyu (which is a 60 euro upgrade) was so tasty.    We had an amazing evening (about 4 hours in total) and I thought We had only been there an hour. Stunning views, great staff and amazing food and wine - equals one of the best dinner out meal in my life. Thank you to all of you for making this amazing"
d696902,April 2022,50,Amazing dinner,Every course was remarkable. The spices really enhanced our meal and the wine selection from Chile went perfectly. Service was outstanding. Worth the splurge.
d696902,April 2022,50,Delicious and a real experience on the 23rd floor,"Wonderful experience and delicious courses. We had the 50 years of anniversary menu, perfectly matching wines served.  The view completed it all!"
d696902,April 2022,50,My favorite restaurant,"Finally after 2,5 years of covid lockdown and no traveling i did a midweek trip to Amsterdam.  I have been waiting for a new amazing evening at ciel bleu. Sence i found this beautiful restaurant over 10 years ago, i try to come back 3-4 times a year. Comeing back after 2,5 year made it even more amazing. The staff is great, food amazing and service impecable. Only good memories in the amazing place"
d696902,April 2022,50,Incredible evening overlooking Amsterdam at Ciel Bleu,"Such a thrill for the four of us to have such a stunning, engaging dining experience at Ciel Blue, a Michelin 2-star restaurant at the legendary Okura Hotel in Amsterdam. Such a pleasure to be pampered by an incredible team led by Sommelier, Nicolo. Every course was meticulously and wonderfully prepared and served. It was a grand 4 1/2 hour event/show with outstanding food and service. We cannot wait to return!"
d696902,April 2022,50,Award winning experience,"You go into a Michelin rated restaurant expecting a one of a kind experience and Ciel Bleu gave us a unique and memorable one. From the beautiful atmosphere to the outstanding food and service, the staff of Ciel Bleu is the best at what they do. I would highly recommend."
d1014732,September 2022,40,Great restaurant and service,"We had a memorable visit just recently. Two very friendly servers efficiently served the entire dining room. Would like to have seen a more complete offering of alcoholic beverages, but the meal was quite good."
d1014732,September 2022,50,Fab-U-lous!,"Absolutely fantastic food and service. Could not fault anything. Wine,food,cocktails!! You have to go here and I don’t review that much."
d1014732,September 2022,50,One of the best fine dining experiences ever,"Goodness me, where to start. One of the best restaurant meals I’ve ever eaten, and all with some of the friendliest service ever. That pana cotta with chocolate mousse inside is to die for."
d1014732,July 2022,50,Superb birthday evening!,"Our third dinner at ZaZ’s was fantastic. The food, service and attention to detail was perfection. This is a must stop in Amsterdam."
d1014732,June 2022,50,Favourite in Dam,"This was our favourite restaurant during our visit to Amsterdam. Located in a lovely part of the city, the food brings together unique flavours and is very tasty. Perfect for couples as the dining area is quite intimate. Highly recommend, and pairs well with a post-dinner trip to Conncertgebouw!"
d1014732,July 2022,50,Lovely just lovey,The best meal I have had in a long while. Visiting for 2 days and chanced upon Zaza. Beautiful small intimate restaurant with amazing food and great service.
d1014732,July 2022,50,Excellent food and experience,"Excellent food and a very nice experience to have dinner here! Not too sophisticated, but definitely more pretentious than an average dinner at a regular restaurant. Very happy we went there!"
d1014732,June 2022,50,Amazing,"Not only was the food absolutely delicious, but also the staff was wonderful! We came with our daughter and they went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. We were a bit in a rush and they responded very fast to each of our needs. Definitely worth a visit!"
d1014732,June 2022,50,Delicious meal in a hip yet quaint setting.,"From the service to the food quality to the vibe, Zaza’s gets a 10/10. Even the cocktails and the wine list was superb. It feels like a home cooked meal but Michelin style. Definitely recommended!"
d1014732,June 2022,50,Delicious food !! Home made,Really good food. Every dish was delicious and special. Definitely recommend this place. Service was also very good and overall great place
d1014732,June 2022,50,Perfect Evening,"Lovely little restaurant, great atmosphere and the food was amazing. I would highly recommend booking as a very small restaurant which we really liked. We cannot wait to come back!"
d1014732,June 2022,50,A must go in Amsterdam,This is a must go place to eat in Amsterdam. We were in the city for four days and have experienced an eclectic and diverse food culture. Zaza is the top of the list. Michelin star food without the prices to match.
d1014732,May 2022,20,Not worth the hype.,I do not understand the highly positive reviews this place gets on TA. The food is OK without more. The atmosphere is uptight and there is no setting worth speaking of. The supposedly trendy yet lousy lounge music is too loud. We decided to skip deserts as a consequence. A decent restaurant yet a disappointing experience overall.
d1014732,April 2022,50,Phenomenal Dining Experience,We enjoyed an incredible evening at Zaza’s in Amsterdam. The food was delicious and the service was impeccable. A very small restaurant where you definitely need a reservation. There was not an item on the diverse menu that we would not have ordered and the wine list had some great wines that accompanied the dinner. Can’t miss experience in Amsterdam.
d1014732,May 2022,50,Incredible - must visit,Absolutely incredible meal and service. Faultless. Everything was delicious. Extremely reasonably priced for the quality of the food. A must visit.
d697058,September 2022,10,Seriously Disappointed,"Our visit to this restaurant spoiled a 3 day visit to Amsterdam. We only had 2 evenings to enjoy and a friend who had dined here, evidently now some years ago , recommended the restaurant and so we allocated precious time and serious money in to visiting here. What a disgrace …. our tiny mackerel starter and seafood soup were ‘nice’ enough but the next 2 larger courses involving a paper bowl with quinoa ( I think) and a beef rendang stew were bland in fact nearly tasteless, apart from the rice that didn’t taste that nice. Our meal concluded with a slice of lemon meringue cake that had a soggy top and was a bit curled at the edges as it had been left uncovered for a while and was so average.  What on earth is going on here ….. ? Staff were nice enough but I agree that they looked like they’d just pulled on some clothes for work and the restaurant itself is actually’mucky’ with candle wax splatters on dusty shelves next to the un table clothed chipped painted tables. Our cutlery was from a bargain shop .  Extortionate prices for the food that was served to us, we really resented handing over 57 Euros per person for what we received and were only grateful we didn’t select the 75 Euro option which was I think was just 2 extra courses of something presumably not up to scratch either. If we hadn’t been with friends creating memories I would have challenged the restaurant manager as felt so strongly overcharged and when money is precious too and fine dining is such a special treat I am writing this as it unfair to spoil people’s experiences.  We went away trying to make light of it and laugh it off but please can the level of food and dining experience be elevated immediately or alternatively drop your prices significantly to reflect the quality of food and diner expectations."
d697058,August 2022,50,Group canal dinner cruise,Abu and team were amazing. I was planning a 40 person dinner canal cruise- and didn’t want the standard offerings. Abu worked with me on the menu options to provide a unique experience. I highly recommend this restaurant or canal cruise!
d697058,June 2022,50,Thrilling Surprise,"Don't come here for traditional rice tables -- there are other places in Amsterdam for that. Do come here for an utterly unique, thrilling, surprising dance party for your taste buds. Pleasant and accommodating staff (I don't eat seafood, and they were happy to help shift the menu). Perhaps my best meal in Amsterdam after many culinary visits."
d697058,June 2022,40,Lovely food.,"Came here on our last day in Amsterdam. It was a lovely experience, starting from the service to the food.    The food was delicious and well presented. My husband had the Sultan Tinder Menu and I had the Vegan option instead.    The last part of the evening started to be a bit boring and slow as we waited too long for the dessert to arrive. For this reason we decided to skip the dessert (that was part of the menu) to leave. The owner was very kind and apologized for the delay and he didn’t make us pay for the dessert.    We left happy for the experience after all.    Lovely place, to try.    General value: 8/10  Food value: 8.5/10"
d697058,May 2022,50,Delicious Indonesian food in a warm welcoming environment,"The concierge at the Marriott highly recommended this restaurant and it did not disappoint. We ordered the multi course meal. Everything was delicious and different than what we have eaten in the US. The staff was friendly, flexible with requests and helpful in explaining the courses. We are at another Indonesian restaurant later in the week and The Blue Pepper was by far the better meal and experience.  The restaurant is small so make reservations and then enjoy your evening meal."
d697058,April 2022,50,Still going strong!,"I was really worried that this place would not live up to the hype, or that it had gotten tired, but I was so pleased to find out I did not need to be concerned! Every dish was wonderful! Inventive yet evocative of traditional Indonesian food. We took our parents, who had never had Indonesian food and do not particularly like Thai or Indian food, and they LOVED it, as did we. And the service was warm, friendly, and prompt. Just a pleasurable experience all around!"
d697058,April 2022,50,Utterly Amazing,"My wife and I have been fortunate enough to travel and experience many parts of the world and try many different restaurants. So when I say this was one of our top two restaurant meals ever - which it was - I don’t say that lightly. We had the Rijsttafel experience last night at Blue Pepper and it was nothing short of amazing. First, the vibe was super-chill, which is so nice after being in a busy city all day. The amberjack tartar was perfectly spiced, the seafood stew was silky and lemony in the best possible way. To this moment, I can’t get over the watermelon course. I’m not kidding. If you had told me it was a tuna steak, I would have believed you. The goose, the quinoa, the shrimp, the water buffalo, the dessert…I could go on and on. My compliments and thanks to the chef and owner who was 100% hands-on the entire experience. It’s a dinner we will never forget."
d697058,April 2022,20,Pretends to be a fine dining restaurant but it really isn't,"I had a great experience at the Blue Pepper a few years ago and decided to return. Sadly, this restaurant is a shadow of its former self. I guess there has been a change of owner?    First impressions were already ominous. The waiter who greeted me was wearing a smart shirt paired with a Nike tracksuit bottom. Not that I particularly care (I'm here for the food), but come on. You are giving off the vibe ""My boss told me to dress smart but I can't be bothered to put in any effort"".    The food itself I would describe as an equally half-hearted attempt at gourmet Indonesian cuisine. Pretentious presentation aside, it was perfectly edible but conventional and rather bland. Some of it seemed microwaved. Nothing you couldn't find for half the price at any low end Indonesian restaurant.    The kids' meal was a joke. I was promised chicken sate with fried rice. Instead I got served the same boiled rice that comes with all the main courses, a huge dollop of fries with ketchup and mayonnaise, and one single tiny chicken skewer. Zero vegetables. They charged 20 Euros for this meal. Even 10 Euros would have been a rip off.    I would have given 3 stars for the food and service, but will subtract one star because they are shamelessly charging gourmet prices for sub-gourmet food."
d697058,November 2021,50,Amazing authentic Indonesian food,Great place for authentic Indonesian cuisine. Great vegan options. Highly recommended! If you want authentic Indonesian food in Amsterdam this place is a must try. It's the perfect location also for a date. The place also looks beautiful and has a warm atmosphere.
d697058,November 2021,30,"Food was edible, prices weren't","Overall, food was decent and edible. Stopped here because it was close to my hotel and I didn't want to walk too far. Customer Service was great, and love that they followed COVID protocols. The fresh fish and seafood soup, with lemongrass and tangy citrus was hot and flavorful. I enjoyed this dish. The spicy, classic slow-cooked Indonesian beef stew didn't wow me, and the rice side dish was overcooked and mushy. Prices were a bit steep too."
d697058,September 2021,50,The place to go !,"My second visit to this restaurant, two years after the first time. Very tasty food, original menu, nice atmosphere, professional service with a smile, great advice on the choice of dishes. I recommend the place to anyone going to Amsterdam. The place is easy to find near Leidesplein."
d697058,August 2021,50,My favorite Indonesian Restaurant in Amsterdam,"I love Blue Pepper's refined cuisine. I really enjoy Indonesian food in general, and I love Blue Pepper especially. Lots of Rijs Tafel restaurants emphasize quantity and number of dishes instead of quality. Here is where Blue Pepper excels. The food is served in five or six different courses instead of all at once and I appreciate that. The quantities are ample and the quality of the food is exceptional."
d697058,February 2020,50,Fantastic Indonesian food,"An overwhelming feast of fish, seafood, meat, game, not to mention a wide array of vegetables and tongue-tickling sorbets. Most noteworthy were prawns and goose, washed down with a tart but delicious German Riesling. One of our best dinners in a long time!"
d697058,February 2020,50,Very special dinner,We had a group dinner here to celebrate a birthday. There were a lot of vegans in the group and everybody was taken care of by the restaurant team perfectly. In fact a full vegan menu was offered to us. The place is cosy with luxe chairs and we enjoyed the evening very much. The ones who had the full fish and meat dinner were also very happy with the choice of this place.
d697058,February 2020,50,Nice evening,"A perfect way to end a rainy day in Amsterdam. From arrival, the blue coloured walls with big wooden masks make for a pleasant atmosphere. The spicy food and warm service helps you recover from the cold in the streets. Tasty and varied menu in nice company, what else can you ask for a perfect evening."
d697009,October 2022,50,Great,"Fantastic food, prepared with delicacy and care in a spectacular environment. Was our third time here and always very special."
d697009,October 2022,50,Best jubileum dinner,We went to Sanzaka for our 11th year together anniversary. We had a lovely chef Rito and hostess Christina. They provided amazing service and the food was amazing!!! Rito and Christina thank you very much for making our day even more special!More
d697009,September 2022,50,"Great food, great service","We’ve enjoyed a really great experience at Sazanka! The food was so flavorful and the service was awesome, thanks to Christina and chef Mitsuki. We look forward to come back again!More"

d697009,August 2022,50,Great anniversary dinner,"Excellent food, with excellent service , can’t get better. The nice anniversary treat was very thoughtful indeed. The menu selection was as always top of the line, do note lobster must be ordered in advance.More"
d697009,August 2022,50,Amazing night with Amazing Food & Service,"I have traveled to Japan many times, but I have never visited a place outside of Japan that captures the kitchen like culture of Japan as well as Sazanka. Wagyu - as mind blowing, as the first time I have tasted it in Kobe. The staff (Tsuzuki, Mitsumi, Christina) were amazing and made tonight a reason to book another trip to Japan. Culinaire holiday in Amsterdam."
d697009,August 2022,50,Wonderful,"Amazing experience! Want to say special thanks for the best steak I've ever eaten to chef Takuma, and also for the delightful service to Mitsumi and Kristina. We enjoyed our dinner here!"
d697009,August 2022,50,Above & Beyond! We will be back!,"Our family had such a wonderful evening here.    Not all fine-dining restaurants respond well to young children, but here all staff was super nice to our two daughters of 4 and 6 years old, and splitting one menu among them was no problem. Our waitress Mitsumi even waited for our daughter at the bathroom to bring her back to the table to make sure she didn't get lost!    The food was superb -- I still dream of the salt crusted seabream that our chef Takuma prepared in front of us. The kids loved how he set the beef on fire :)    Good sommeliers are hard to find these days, but Menno really knows his sake and wines. He immediately sensed that we are into wine, so he took all the time to give us tailor-made advice and let us taste some extraordinary wines.    Finally, Christina our head-waitress, thank you so much for making this an unforgettable experience! She was continuously on top of everything and made sure all went smooth.    We've seen lately that a lot of restaurants (even the supposedly top ones) are cutting corners after covid and due to staff shortage, but not here at Sazanka. Just old-fashioned good service and food with all bells and whistles. We can't wait to go back!"
d697009,July 2022,50,"Delicious Dinner, Great hospitality",Always great experience having dinner here. Enjoy the seasonal summer menu with Wagyu from Saka prefecture.    Services from Akiko and Kota san is second-to-none. ご馳走様でした

d697009,July 2022,50,Celebration,Wonderful service by waiter Asahi and amazing cooking by chef Roku. Super good food and a great vibe.    110% come back!
d697009,June 2022,50,"What a vist! Delicious, unforgettable and unpretentious","Well, what is there to say only - fabulous. We were a family group of six celebrating something special. From the moment we walked in, we were treated like honoured guests but also with a warm familiarity. We were served by Akiko, Takuma, Meno and Christina, who were so lovely, attentive and kind.  And then came the food - Takuma was our chef. He patiently and kindly put up with all our questions and chatted with us. We had the seasonal menu, which was, of course, the standard that you would expect cooked at your table with impeccable presentation. Simply delicious! Menno guided us through the wine and saki menu with fun and incredible knowledge. Aniko and Christina appeared unobtrusively to explain the dishes and attend to requests. I can only thank each of the team for making our evening so memorable and special."
d697009,June 2022,50,"Excellent service, food and wine.","Thank you for a really lovely evening with both Hiroto and Christina being excellent and wonderful. The food, wine and service was excellent. Thanks also to the brilliant sommelier whose name I missed. Thank you all. Top stuff"

d1955652,August 2022,50,Best herring sandwich ever!,"Went there with my friends to try the traditional herring sandwich. The owner was very kind and gentle and needless to say we got extremely enthusiastic about the herring sandwich - it is delicious! I understand that it may not be for everyone, but if you enjoy strong flavours I totally recommend it! We got ours served in a nice hot dog bun topped with pickles and white onions. It was a true revelation! We also enjoyed some bits of fried cod which were extremely tender and flavourful. If you happen to come to Amsterdam and want to try one of its most typical dishes, this is the place to go!"
d1955652,August 2022,50,HERRING HEAVEN,Wonderful little backstreet cafe Worth all the hype Had 2 herring sandwiches Astonishing Best herring ever Washed down with Amstel Ridiculous value for money It really doesn’t get any better
d1955652,July 2022,50,"Excellent, cheap, good service, friendly, quick. Tasty food. Speak number of languages including Russian.","Excellent, cheap, good service, friendly, quick. Tasty food. Excellent place for a quick bite near the Dam square. Speak number of languages including Russian."
d1955652,May 2022,50,Must visit,"Very tasty herring! The staff is friendly and polite! Although, make sure you have cash, they don't accept cards. The place itself is quite small, most likely you will have to finish your herring in the streets nearby."
d1955652,May 2022,50,Authentic and excellent,"It is simple, but the quality is excellent. Try not only the Matjes, the smoked eel is outstanding. You can bring in a glass of Genever from the bar across the street"
d1955652,January 2020,40,Good food,"Primarily a takeout with a couple of tables serving very good fresh herring and an assortment of other seafood such as smoked eel,smoked salmon,several pickled herring,and four or five fried fish such as cod. Also an assortment of herring and seafood salads. Enjoyed the fresh herring,smoked eel,pickled herring and their beet smoked salmon and herring salad on more then one occasion over the years."
d1955652,September 2020,50,The best herring in Amsterdam.,The best herring in Amsterdam. The staff is very kind and the food is delicious. I suggest the classic herring with a good Dutch bier
d1955652,August 2019,50,Fresh Herring Sandwich,"Come here for the fresh herring sandwich. This is our 3rd time back after visiting twice in 2014. Same cheerful owner, same delicious fresh herring sandwich. Will return if we visit Amsterdam again."
d1955652,July 2020,50,Delicious,"An old traditional two table restaurant , best herring and salmon sandwiches I’ve ever experienced. Must try"
d1955652,March 2019,50,The best sandwich spot with the nicest owner!,"I highly recommend a trip to this amazing little shop/cafe; get chatting to the owner about choices, he's highly knowledgeable and full of good local facts! Make sure you try something local; I had the Mackrel sandwich which was scrummy."
d1955652,February 2020,50,Super tasty,"If you're visiting Amsterdam and interested in affordable and delicious local food, this is the place to be. Excellent service and freshly cooked food. More than one reason to return!"
d1955652,December 2019,50,Simple yet delicious,"It can be so simple. Herring, pickle, baguette, little bit of side vegetables. Nothing better to settle your stomach after a night out. This was a great place to do that for us. The food was delicious."
d1955652,January 2020,50,Super fresh and super cheap,"Make sure to try their traditional Dutch herring. The freshest herring I’ve ever tasted, and I come from Lithuania - country of herring experts."
d1955652,December 2019,30,Average quality,"Average quality, heating the fried fish in the microwave.. didn't try the hearing .. the place is to small and the street not kids friendly"
d1955652,November 2019,10,Not a fish restaurant!,"Mostly raw herring in different forms, very limited options, but we tried the fried fish sandwich and it is little bits of deep-fried oily fish on hard white bread with pickles. Nothing to be excited about."
d10275170,September 2022,50,Amazing! Thank you ❤,That's my second visit at this lovely place and I am not disappointed again! Amazing burgers with lot of choices and wonderful taste! Stuff is friendly and professional at the same time. This place is worth to be ❤ Thank you!
d10275170,July 2022,50,Amazing food. A must visit,"We searched this place on trip advisor. Took two teams to get there and boy was it worth it! Amazing burgers!!!! Tiberius our waiter was very helpful with the menu. Texas burger, Hottie Burger and Nachos with chilli can’t go wrong."
d10275170,July 2022,50,Beautiful day,Perfect burger on a perfect day in Amsterdam. We came in early and had a great lunch while enjoying the backyard and good beer.
d10275170,July 2022,50,Lovely burgers,"Tried the burgers it to be honest one the top 5 restaurants for burgers in Ams for me, tasty and juicy burgers well cocked and it’s a cozy place. Recommended if you’re around this area ♥️👌🏼"
d10275170,July 2022,50,Great atmosphere and staff,"Visited this place with my team during the floorball tournament in Amsterdam. Very tasty burgers with very friendly staff. As a matter of fact one was from our neighboring country - Lithuania, which made the experience even more flattering 🤩😎"
d10275170,July 2022,50,Fantastic Burger in Amsterdam,"While exploring the area of our B&B, we found this gem of a place. You knew something was good by how many of the tables had ""Reserved"" signs on them. Best burger (BBQ) I've had anywhere and puts ""Red Robin"" to shame."
d10275170,July 2022,40,Amazing veggie burger and friendly staff,"Got off to a tough start. Came there with my friends, we had booked a table but no server came up to us in a long time so we sat down on our down. Then they asked us to change table for a bigger group of people, which was fine but it was before they even greeted us or gave us menus. Just a small, strange first impression, service wise. They all proved me wrong after that though, very friendly and caring. Food was amazing. I don't know what it was, it's almost as if Amsterdam put something special in their food - tasted great. Took their veggie burger which was insane, very realistic grilled meat patty feeling even though it was vegan. Fries very heavenly. This is a fantastic burger place with a chill vibe. Nothing fancy but still cozy! Good music too :)"
d10275170,May 2022,50,Don't miss this place,Brilliant burgers. Great service. Superb atmosphere. It is well run and very friendly. Don't miss this place. I recommend.
d10275170,May 2022,50,Best Burgers!,"Had the best high quality burger ever! Also very friendly service who helped us, to order only as much food as we might achieve."
d10275170,April 2022,40,Very delicious and very good quality,Delicious Burgers for good prices! The burgers are really big and have a good quality. Also the service is very friendly. The only thing what is a little bit „negative“ is that it was very loud and cold in there.
d10275170,March 2022,50,Tasty burgers!,"This is a nice burger restaurant. The atmosphere is pleasant and the staff is both efficient and friendly. We loved our burgers: cheese burger and bacon burger. We took two portions of fries: classic and the sweet potatoes and this was almost too much! Sweet potatoes fries were the best. Good selection of beers too. We paid 44€ for two burgers, two portions of fries and two beers. You won't leave hungry. Enjoy!"
d10275170,April 2022,50,Amazing ❤️,"Love this place!! The food is very good, the service is so helpful and sweet. The restaurant is located on a very good place. Thank you so much for everything ❤"
d10275170,March 2022,50,Amazing burgers with fresh ingredients,"I strongly recommend Happy Bull if you're ever craving for some good burgers. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very cosy, owner are lovely and the food is outstanding. I know where I'll be eating next time I go to Amsterdam"
d10275170,March 2022,50,Fantastic burgers with so much to choose from!,Fabulous food and great service!! The burgers were delicious and cooked perfectly. The menu is great for everyone! I can’t recommend this place enough for a great dinner.
d10275170,March 2022,10,Disappointing,"We drove all the way from the center of Amsterdam for this restaurant and it is really scammed us.  The food is not good and everything was burned.  We reserved a table before we came and they put us in the back of the restaurant in the darkest place they found.  It looks like the deliveries was top priority and not us waiting for the food for about 45 minutes.  Really shame we drove 25 minutes for this restaurant only because somehow it is highly recommended and it is the worst.  People look out, it's scam."
d1014753,September 2022,50,Cozy breakfast place,We had a cozy & very delicious breakfast here on our last day in Amsterdam. Everything was very tasty & intimate. The lady who attended our table was very attentive as well. Recommended 👍
d1014753,August 2022,50,A very nice place for a quick lunch,"This place is very easy to miss, as it’s located on a small and quiet street between to busy streets. The staff is very friendly and the food was excellent. I would recommend making a reservation."
d1014753,July 2022,50,High tea delight,"A hidden gem in one of the more quiet side streets of the buzzling Kalverstraat. The location was beautiful, intimate and cozy. We decided to go for savory high tea version. You could choose a pot of tea for two (really enjoyed Les Invités). We had a soup and a variation of different sandwiches and a quiche (which was eggy, somewhat fluffy - just divine). It was a rollercoaster ride of different flavors. The staff was warm and welcoming. You won’t be disappointed."
d1014753,June 2022,50,Great farm fresh food,"Small, intimate dining experience with incredible farm fresh food options. Amazing desserts. The High tea service is very good. Will be going back"
d1014753,June 2022,50,Amazing,"Amazing place, so Cosy , good service and delicious food. The deco was so pretty. The staff/owner so friendly and had the best breakfast"
d1014753,June 2022,50,Lovely breakfast spot🫶,Just perfect breakfast in lovely surroundings and the staff was so friendly - can only recommend this place🌟 Consider to reserve a table as it is a small place and very popular 😊
d1014753,May 2022,50,Excellent,"A lovely little brunch restaurant tucked away in a side street, 5 minutes walk from Dam Square. The ambiance is charming, service extremely friendly and the food is excellent. Booking a table is recommended as it's a small place and almost always busy."
d1014753,March 2022,40,If it's the food that matters,The neighbourhood is nothing special and the restaurant itself overlooks a dusty alley but the food was excellent and the staff very friendly. Reservations are necessary on the weekends.
d1014753,December 2021,50,Very Nice Breakfast,"The breakfast was very tasty! Kirsten and Willem-Jan are so welcomed! Good healthy food, good location, Good address for a nice moment ;)"
d1014753,October 2021,50,Hidden surprise,We stumbled across this place by accident when we turned down a tiny street while exploring Amsterdam. I took notice to a couple enjoying tea from a lovely tea service bt the window and had to take a look. Out of curiosity we decided to try it. There happened to be a table outside and even though they were fully booked we were lucky enough to get a spot. We were beyond surprised. The food was great (their soup made from veggies out of their own garden was amazing) the service was wonderful. We will definitely be going back.
d1014753,September 2021,50,The best eggs I have ever,The best eggs I have ever tried In my life and the staff was really polite and joyfull. It is a must in this town!
d1014753,September 2021,50,I'll be a regular now,"Definitely I will frequent this place. Tasteful recipes, smiley faces, warm atmosphere. Loved it. Unsurprising it got this many positive reviews."
d1014753,June 2021,50,Delicate tasty dishes,"Eventho the menu writes clearly what every dish is, it was hard to imagine what to eat or how the flavors would be combined. The dishes are delicate dishes, unique and the one with PEAS AND PARMSANE cheese was delicious, super tasty and HEALTHY. The lettuce even was nicely seasoned and crunchy. Would come here again!"
d1014753,June 2021,50,"Great place, better reserve !","There are not so many tables and it is better to reserve, if you are lucky and could enjoy their breakfast, you can only applause the choice of fresh jam, tasty toast, choice of tea. French Breakfast, eggs Bénédictin , you name it they have it. Super friendly personnel, fast service.  Will come back !"
d1014753,September 2020,50,Wonderful food,"Amazing good, healthy and also delicious food. The ingredients are all fresh and grown in their own garden! You can definitely taste this in the dishes"
d7695005,October 2022,50,"Great food, friendly and unpretentious service",It was perfect from start to finish. The pairing of wine with the food was perfect too. We had the 6 course tasting menu. Well worth it.
d7695005,August 2022,50,Absolutely Fantastic Cuisine!,"This restaurant appears very understated. We took the six course option, and even though the portions were small, we left comfortably full! We understand why this is a Michelin-rated feast."
d7695005,August 2022,50,Wonderful restaurant - we got engaged at the end of the meal!,"This lovely little restaurant had the perfect atmosphere, with only a handful of tables seated around us. We felt well attended, with drinks and food flowing. We had the chef's surprise 6 course menu and added a cheeseboard. Bread and two canape-like dishes were also brought out on-top of the 6 courses (so 8 plates in total). I have not had another dining experience like it. The food tasted and looked incredible and each dish complimented the next. We hope to come back in several years to celebrate our anniversary."
d7695005,August 2022,50,Delicious and reasonably-priced haute cuisine…,"It’s a great place. Relatively small and not bang in the centre. It’s the food that you come for though. Six courses plus a few extra amouses and petit fours. What I was particularly happy about is that often with these tasting menus you get terribly excited after a few starters then the main courses disappoint. Not the case here. The chef keeps his powder dry early on and the menu builds to some really delicious mains. I was here with my family for my sons birthday and we were well looked after and everyone thoroughly enjoyed the food and the evening as a whole. The bill when it came was very reasonable and I thought it represented excellent value for money for the quality of cuisine (you’ll spend double at some restaurants in the centre). Would definitely recommend. We will return. I am sure it’s Michelin star is just round the corner (when presumably they’ll put their prices up, so get in there while you can!)"
d7695005,August 2022,50,Excellent meal and experience,"We went for the 5 course tasting menu and wine by the glass to match the courses which was great. Food was amazing. Atmosphere was relaxed and not stuffy, staff were friendly. It was for a special birthday and certainly fitted the bill!"
d7695005,August 2022,50,Amazing food!,Absolutely loved this restaurant! The chef was so imaginative with the food and everything was delicious! The service was also lovely so only positive things to say
d7695005,July 2022,50,Superb set menu - relax and enjoy your evening,We went for the 6 course tasting menu and it was amazing. Service was attentive but discreet. We sat near to the kitchen so we could see the attention to detail from the chefs. We went for the wine by the glass to match the courses and the variety of wine was fantastic too. So ultimately a wide variety of food having gone for the meat and fish dishes - every mouthful was really tasty.
d7695005,July 2022,50,Amazing food and great matching wine,"this restaurant was in the vicinity of where we stayed in Amsterdam. It was recommended in our guide book and received rave reviews on Tripadvisor. Congratulations to my guidebook (lonely planet) and Tripadviser, this restaurant is exceptional. The small front of house team managed a full restaurant, switching easily between multiple languages. The kitchen team produced food of a high standard. My wife went vegetarian. I had meat and fish. None of the 10 dishes disappointed. Even better, the matching wines were perfect accompaniments for the food.  A word of warning: there isn't a menu; the food presented reflects what is in season and available. The choice will be the number of courses you choose (4-6), but don't let that put you off, they will respect any food allergies preferences and create a lovely memory for you."
d7695005,July 2022,50,Excellent meal,We had the 6-course surprise meal last night and it was a great meal. Very nuanced tastes with every plate. The desert was amazing as well. We all felt that the service was fantastic it was a fun evening and the food was a real treat.
d7695005,June 2022,40,Fantastic food with relaxing atmosphere,"Diner was great, even with a very difficult eater. The staff and chef did their utmost best to give us fantastic food. The atmosphere is relaxed and easy going making it an visit to remember."
d7695005,June 2022,50,Lovely restaurant!,"We had a lovely 4 course menu. Tastes were inventive and creative. Nice staff, no long waits. Nice atmosphere. We had a very good experience. Will come back!"
d7695005,June 2022,50,take your taste buds for a tour,"We took our taste buds for a 5 course adventure and loved every course! Flavours were surprising, yet balanced. Friendly and considerate staff. Worth visiting this hidden gem at the end of Overtoom."
d7695005,June 2022,50,Great Experience and Value,"Great and imaginative food expertly prepared and served. From the amuse bouches, through 6 courses, a cheese plate and wine pairings, everything was amazing. Would happily return any time. Adam is also great value. Inexpensive for the quality of the experience."
d7695005,June 2022,50,Very enjoyable first visit,"The format of a “surprise menu, either carnivore or vegetarian” took a bit of faith but my dinner at Restaurant Adam was very good, the staff are organised and efficient and the service is perfect. The menu is creative yet un-pretentious, delivering flavoursome, unfussy dishes with obvious technical skill and attention to detail. I look forward to my next visit."
d7695005,June 2022,40,Surprise tasting menu,"The food was delicious and served with style. There’s a choice of 4 course, 5 course or 6 course surprise tasting menus (meat & fish or vegetarian). The wines by the glass were well priced."
d3893242,June 2022,50,Absolutely loved this place,"Friendly folks, great beer, cozy, best spot I went to in Amsterdam. Try the house IPA. If you like drinking somewhere relaxed and unpretentious the Golem is perfect."
d3893242,May 2022,50,Still a favourite place,"Small bar near to Spui which has a distinctive, very lived-in interior and a regular, garrulous& friendly crowd."
d3893242,April 2022,50,Little bit of heaven on earth!,Wonderful friendly service Brilliant atmosphere Unbelievable selection of draft and bottled beers Definitely be back here!
d3893242,March 2022,50,Here Every Night,In Amsterdam for three nights and visited here on a recommendation. Came all three nights we were in Amsterdam. Wonderful place. Small place but great atmosphere. Tremendous selection of beers from Belgium and Nederlands.......Brown cafe ambience was perfect. Bar staff a bit unhelpful.
d3893242,November 2021,50,Love it!,"Biercafe Gollem is great! Always lively with a great atmosphere, large selection of beers and nice bites to eat! We've been here quite a few times now and always enjoyed it!"
d3893242,March 2020,50,"Gollum, the one and only","I’ve been enjoying beer and conversation at Gollum for many years. It is the Perfect beer cafe. Brown cafe ambience that cannot be faked, only accumulated over decades....small and intimate, gezellig in every respect. And an astounding beer selection. Beyond belief, given the minuscule size of the bar...I generally go with the current seasonal or featured draft, ably assisted by the erudite and friendly barkeeper. This is a perfect place for the solo traveler to take a beer break and meet fascinating people from all over the world. You can’t get more Amsterdam than this place. And, it is mere steps from Spui, my favorite square.  The best thing? I just saw it on the menu board (which covers the entire wall). Just down in the corner, after the hundreds of beers, is the small notation: “yes, we have no biterballen”. Long may they run. And drink."
d3893242,March 2020,50,Great beers; lovely atmosphere.,Great beers and a lovely atmosphere in there. The barman was friendly and helpful. Sometimes it is hard to find a seat as it can be quite busy.
d3893242,February 2020,50,It must have been like this in the sixtees!,"Biercafe Gollem is hidden in one of the alleys of a street that borders the renown 9 little streets of Amsterdam.    Old interior and walls filled with wooden plaques with beer names add to a dreamy atmosphere of this two- level rather small but warm place. It is a beer pub, and the beer selection is great, combined with generous cheese boards and with music coming from the background that one would wish to be slightly louder at times. It is a great place to spend an hour or two and wonder how it must have felt being in Amsterdam in the summer (or winter :)) of 1969; definitely a place that deserves a second (and more) visit;"
d3893242,February 2020,50,Just brilliant,"Some kind of beer radar steered my wife to the alleyway this bar is on. Several hours later, having sampled a range of bottled and draft beers (loved the Gollem Precious IPA especially) conversed with several somewhat inebriated drinkers from Holland and the world, chilled out and watched the world going by, we sadly had to leave. Just a wonderful place to spend time."
d3893242,February 2020,40,Brilliant beer,"Biercafe Gollem is a no frills pub. It serves a large variety of excellent beers. A bit expensive but worth it, 5 Euros of a 1/4 litre of 10% proof craft beer. Good atmosphere."
d3893242,February 2020,50,Cracking bar with cracking beers (and cheese),"My second visit to Biercafe Gollem having stumbled across it on a previous visit to Amsterdam. Amazing array of beers both on tap and bottled. Knowledgeable bar staff, correct glass for each beer and good music.    Can highly recommend Satan Gold and don't forget the cheese platter. A match made in heaven. Will visit if i come to Amsterdam again"
d3893242,January 2020,50,Extensive beer collection,Extensive beer collection and great cheese board. Stopped in for a drink. It was a dark cozy space with good service. Enjoyed our large snack and a few beers. Could have stayed the afternoon!
d3893242,December 2019,50,A favourite place,"Always worth a visit. Warm, welcoming with a very good tap list plus hundreds in bottles. Open from 16.00 til late. Well-recommended."
d3893242,November 2019,50,Favourite Bar,Probably my favourite bar anywhere in the world. Amazing selection of beers in a very cosy and friendly setting.
d3893242,October 2019,50,"Small, but mighty!","Great beer place! Very small, but an abundant selection of beers. I visit it on every Amsterdam trip!"
d1408533,September 2022,50,Excellent,"If you are looking for a classic gourmet temple, move on. The Daalder gives you 150 beats per minute and modern design. The tables are spacious. The staff is very welcoming, and everyone is taking care of the guests. We had in total at least seven people attending.  The food was speedily delivered and tasted formidable. Our glasses were never empty during the meal. The dishes were explained and if necessary, the waiters shared some personal recommendations.  The tasting experience was outstanding. The presentations and arrangements of the different dishes was excellent.  A perfect meal for a special celebration."
d1408533,July 2022,50,My all-time personal favorite,"By far, the best dining experience of my 65 year-long life. Every chorus was fantastic. Seeing the culinary team in action only enhance the dining experience. If you are in Amsterdam, this is the one restaurant you must see."
d1408533,June 2022,50,Looked after a solo traveller,As a solo traveller I am sometimes cautious about visiting ‘posh’ restaurants- but Daalder looked after me from start to finish. I don’t frequent Michelin starred restaurants (this is only my 3rd - and will accept that 1 of those was the Singapore hawker) but this is the best I’ve tried so far. I was amazed at the variety of changing tastes and food quality. Highly worth a visit. My usual food is McDonald’s but I was happy to pay the Daalder price for the service and food I received.
d1408533,May 2022,50,The Epitome of Gezelligheid,"Daalder is first and foremost a gracious and yet unfussy example of kind and welcoming hospitality. Each and every member of staff walks, talks and works with an upbeat tempo that clearly demonstrates their enthusiasm for delivering a top notch dining experience. The artistic expression evident in the decor, the food and the ambience all seem to stem from a very positive and affirming root. What grows from that root is a space clearly designed to facilitate the art of cuisine, the art of conversation and most of all: the art of gezelligheid.    We chose the Daalder Experience tasting menu with the sommelier’s exclusives wine paring. Brilliant. We added the wagyu course as well. Each exquisitely prepared plate was delivered with great enthusiasm - with head chef Dennis Huwaë himself even delivering a few. Staff seemed to love working with each other, love the cuisine they served and love providing a great experience for the guests.    The brilliant hospitality is matched by a vibrant, pulsing energy that animates the proceedings while still invoking a relaxed, luxuriously contemplative pace of dining. We concluded our repast sated and yet not sedated, with a firm desire to return."
d1408533,February 2022,20,Average and arrogant,"Our journey in this one star Michelin restaurant started with the following conversation: Guest ""Do you have portwine?"" Waitress: ""I have to ask"". The waitress comes back after 5 minutes: ""yes we do have portwine."" Guest: ""what kind of portwine do you have?"" Waitress: ""a good one"". Guest: well i ean: is there only one portwine or are there different kinds?"" Waitress: ""i have to ask"".    Well if this the quality of the staff you know its going to be a tough night. Conclusion: Food very average, wine good but glasses only half full en prices sky high, staff horrible."
d1408533,March 2022,10,"What a terrible place to go, never again!","What a terrible place. The waiters look annoyed all the time and the food was terrible. Never again. Especially the price to food comparison, my god."
d1408533,February 2022,50,Fabulous Valentine's Day Menu,"It started at the front of house and ended with the waitress who guided us to the exit at the end - impeccable, friendly, amazing service. Every person we came across was incredibly helpful, polite and fun! The food itself was delicious and though the pouring of the wine within the pairing was a little less (quantity wise) than what we're used to, it was still a great addition. The Espresso Martinis were great, the quantity of food left us feeling perfectly full and the quality of most dishes was A* (the octopus and pigeon my partner had were not cooked to his liking but that may have been just preference). If I had to nit-pick I'd say towards the end the speed at which the wine & food came was quite slow and we could have done with an in-between cocktail. The vibes were great, even though one song by Kylie Minogue played at least 7 times, but we had a good laugh about it. Loved the decor - especially the neon lights. I would say the price compared to other tasting menus at this caliber was a little steep, however nothing to complain about. Would definitely come again for a another menu, perhaps within a different season!"
d1408533,November 2021,50,Amsterdam,"Been on a lot of trips here an never disappointing, always great to see the streets lit up with Xmas lights just adds to the trip"
d1408533,November 2021,50,"Should be a 2 star, this place is amazing ❤️","Very well deserved Michelin star for this restaurant. I had such an amazing time with my family for my birthday celebration.  Very young and professional team, always ready to help you with enthusiasm, it change from classic Michelin service.  All 8 dishes were balanced and perfectly mastered."
d1408533,November 2021,20,"Bad service, does not get a cool location into a nice place","What a disappointment. As such the location is cool and we came with big expectation. However, I have never experienced such bad service in a one star Michelin restaurant. Have been greeted at the entrance friendly and encompassed to our table. All good up to then. Our waitress was in bad mood and did let us feel this as well. We did not really felt welcomed. We ordered champagne for aperitif. She filled in the Glas and I doubt that this was the normal 0,1 glass. We got the wine list before we saw the menu. The sommelier nevertheless was good and made good proposals however always more expensive then the wine we thought about. The waitress are more chosen by their looking then by their hospitality or charme. Yes it is a cool place but if you want to be really cool, then let tge guest feel it. Several times we had to ask to get more wine of our bottle. None asked us whether we want to have red wine for the main course or a dessert wine for the dessert. We feels liked ignored. In the end one waitress wanted to take our wine glasses, but we told her that there should be more wine in our bottle. She never came back. We had to ask another waitress and quite unwillingly got the bottle which had two glasses left. The food was good but not really exceptional. No real aroma explosion which you would expect in a one star Micheline restaurant. I really wonder why they have received the star. If you want to see waitress looking like models in a cool place go there, otherwise avoid it."
d1408533,September 2021,50,Very very nice food! Definitely,Very very nice food! Definitely Michelin worth. Gorgeous combination of flavors! A must to go in Amsterdam
d1408533,September 2021,40,Very good dinner,"I selected this restaurant based on the trajectory of the chef,  Beatiful ambiance and excellent music.  We started with their own Spicy Negroni,and it was delicious,we asked for the second one and it was not the same,although the bartender came to the table ,and prepared another one.  Food was very good although the menu is a little confusing ,I prefer eating a la carte .  When we were leaving the bartender offered a shot of the spicy gin they use for the Negroni!"
d1408533,July 2021,40,Very good!,"We have been here with friends for a dinner. Very nice place to bee, nice food and service. I loved the appetizers...I'll be back !"
d1408533,August 2021,20,Waiter was touching my knife while I was eating one of the courses.,"I was visiting Daalder restaurant earlier this week with a group of friends. The restaurant recently moved to a new location and obtained one star so we decided to check it out. Overall food was delicious however the reason for the review is a bit surprising and completely unexpected behavior of one of the waiters who was serving our table. While I was eating one of the courses, I was cutting the meat with a wrong side of the knife. The waiter noticed that but instead of politely advising which side of the knife is the right one, he just silently took the knife together with my hand and changed the side helping to cut the meat. And then he silently walk away. This was completely unexpected and inappropriate behavior in the Michelin star restaurant. Totally ruined my impression of the place. Very unfortunate as the food was delicious. Not coming back."
d1408533,June 2021,50,Probably the best food I have ever eaten,"What a fabulous restaurant experience.  Firstly, a relaxed & friendly vibe, a very unassuming bistro feel.  Secondly, superb staff, all super efficient, offering excellent service throughout the meal at exactly the right time, and very friendly with it. Thirdly, the food is absolutely excellent.  Each & every dish a standout, sensational delight. We went for the 10 course tasting menu, which offered an amazing array of well balanced dishes, each with some unusual & surprising flavour combinations, but each one equally outstanding with rich & intense bursts of flavour. I could not fault a single element, it was simply 10 out of 10 for each mouthful & the whole experience."
d3200493,August 2022,40,Nice relaxing canal side breakfast,"Good breakfast with a nice canal view. Very good portion size and lots of quality ham on the eggs Benedict!  Would had been 5 out of 5 but I think it’s too much for breakfast, almost €50 for 2 drinks and 2 breakfasts was not really what we had budgeted for oops.  However, if you want really good quality then come here but it’s just on the pricey side compared to many other places for breakfast"
d3200493,July 2022,50,Excellent brunch or breakfast,"Lovely canalside spot for breakfast, with an excellent range of choices on the menu. Good size portions and typically priced for the centre of town. Friendly and quick service - worth the wait, there was a queue every time we walked past!"
d3200493,August 2022,40,"Nice food, big portions. Pretty expensive.","I visited Greenwoods with my kids. There are no Dutch menu's, everything is English. We did like the food although for kids it was way too much. The prices are definitely on the high end..."
d3200493,August 2022,50,AMAZING!!!!,"Amazing service, honest food that’s delicious. Great drinks. I ordered the salmon royale and it was out of this world. The staff here are also very kind and hardworking. I highly recommend!!!!"
d3200493,July 2022,50,The perfect pit stop,Had to wait a while for a table and it truly paid dividends. A diverse but neat brunch menu. We had the pancakes with scrambled eggs and bacon which were delicious. Table service excellent . Enjoy
d3200493,June 2022,50,Excellent Breakfast,"Next to the canal, but we chose to dine indoors as It was a windy morning. Wall murals depicting Dutch history. Excellent food with friendly service."
d3200493,July 2022,50,Family food and gluten free,We had a tables booked in little place as my wife is gluten free there was a lot of options for her lovely setting by the canal all our food was spot on the waitress was a very nice Irish girl really helpful and also very busy we have been to one of these in edinburgh and this was just as good portions are large and we were all very full thanks guys keep up the good work
d3200493,June 2022,50,Lovely brunch visit,Amazing little brunch spot. Our server was from Ireland and was the most accommodating. The eggs in the shakshouka were perfectly cooked. Ginger tea was excellent and even though we showed up near they didn’t rush us out as it approached closing time.    Our favourite outdoor brunch on the canal experience.
d3200493,April 2022,40,Great place and friendly staff,Came to Greenwoods for breakfast. The egg Benedict was delicious. Liis was absolutely lovely and very friendly. Would definitely recommend this place for breakfast and Lunch!
d3200493,April 2022,50,Lovely Breakfast....,"Luckily, we were in time before the queues started, though the cafe was still very busy. Breakfast was lovely, and service was great also. I would highly recommend this place. We had the veggie breakfast, Shakshuka and French Toast. Hot chocolate was great also."
d3200493,April 2022,50,Excellent breakfast,Excellent breakfast. The food was exceptional and lots of choice the pancakes were delicious. The staff were friendly too.
d3200493,March 2022,50,Tremendously good,"This was a near perfect breakfast experience...two days running. The choice is great. New Amsterdam Eggs Benedict was fantastic......the pancakes too. Coffee good as well. Staff fantastic. Great ambience and socially aware not using avocados because of the environmental impact. Staff very skilled as bringing three plates down a spiral staircase...without accident!"""
d3200493,April 2022,40,Great service!,"The food was incredible hear, fantastic coffee and particularly excellent service from Ebbonnie who seemed overworked but did a great job anyway! Highly recommend this place for a brunch any time of the year. Shame the terrace didn’t open until 2 hours after our reservation but inside turned out to be very nice."
d3200493,March 2022,50,Perfect brunch!,"A really diverse brunch menu and really filling (didn’t need to eat for the rest of the day…!) when it came. I had the pancakes and the scrambled eggs were a treat as was the bacon - smoothies also hit the spot. Eb, our waitress, was very sweet - looked after us!"
d3200493,March 2022,50,Sex on a plate,"Was the most amazing poached eggs and smoked salmon I’ve ever eaten. The presentation and everything about it was Devine. The orange juice was freshly squeezed and was the freshest thing mankind could ask for. Highly recommend and you won’t be disappointed. The staff are also so welcoming and accommodating, such friendly and made the breakfast one remembering"
d8562698,August 2022,50,absoultley the best,"These guys take eggs to the next level, what a great place. Shame its so busy but its a great thing, peanut butter omelette was amazing"
d8562698,September 2022,50,Just great,"Great food and great location. Well worth tracking down this place. Staff are friendly, welcoming and the food is even better."
d8562698,July 2022,50,Big Ben,Big Ben is the best i think. But its little bit expencive althought it shown cheapest like “ $ “. Enjoy with your meal 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
d8562698,June 2022,50,So delicious!,"Great brunch, fun lineup, sweet cozy bright place, friendly and engaging staff. Fresh juice, delicious omelettes."
d8562698,July 2022,50,Amazing food,"Worth the wait, lovely small place with the best omelette I ever had in my life. Defined will go back and try the other ones! The queue always looks big but it moves fast so wait, trust me you will not regret. The service is so polite and kind that adds more value to the experience"
d8562698,June 2022,20,Very dissapointed - overpriced and bad,"When I ordered an omelette it came very fast - which was nice. However it was very undercooked. I asked the server if I could please have a new one that was properly cooked and when she came with the ""new"" plate it was literally the same. They had just taken the omelette I just complained about and given it 1 more minute on the stove. The apple juice I ordered was almost warm not even close to cooled. The atmosphere is very nice but in no way compensates for the bad food."
d8562698,June 2022,20,Not so good,"It wasn’t that good as reviews suggest, it wasn’t worth the que or the wait for table. Omelette wasn’t cooked properly was soggy."
d8562698,June 2022,30,"If you have good requirements, this is not the place for you.","There were things I could potentially have, and I asked if they could be modify but the answer was no. I just had an orange juice while my husband had the Shakshuka dish.    If you are vegan, diary free, or potentially don’t like a dish and ask if they could make some changes, it won’t possible."
d8562698,June 2022,10,Not family friendly. Parents beware,"We were literally just kicked out by the manager because we came with our baby who was sleeping in her stroller.    We sat at the table and had coffee, then asked if we can move to another table where employees wouldn't keep bumping into the stroller. The manager then said ""we're not baby friendly"" then asked us to leave.    Worst experience in Amsterdam which is normally super friendly to parents."
d8562698,May 2022,40,They do Omelettes better than anyone!,"We waited quite a while to get a table and the menu is limited, but there is a reason for that - their omelettes are the best!! My food was incredible and the friends I was with found the same with theirs. We would highly recommend eating here!"
d8562698,June 2022,50,A tasty brekkie in a cute setting,Well worth a visit. Tasty food served by friendly staff in quite a cute little restaurant. Freshly squeezed juice and good coffee with a choice of omelettes make a great start to your day.
d8562698,May 2022,40,Very good,Very nice breakfast. Large omelette very well prepared and tasty. Great ingredients. Overall good and very reasonable value for the money
d8562698,March 2022,30,Overrated,"Lady that served us was very friendly, staff were nice. Breakfast was average at best. For the price I don’t think we will return."
d8562698,November 2021,10,Felt very unsafe,"Food is fine for breakfast choices. However the tables are crammed in, the staff don’t wear masks and this was the one cafe / restaurant we visited in Amsterdam where there was no attempt made to check whether we had a negative LFD in the preceding 24 hours. Everywhere else we went, including the museums, seats outside cafes, the boat trip, checked our QR codes and ID before we were allowed over the threshold. This felt quite unsafe. They did not check anyone."
d8562698,July 2020,40,Tasty breakfast,We went here for breakfast while in Amsterdam. The waitress was really friendly and helped us with recommendations as this was our first time. I chose the Pulled chicken omelette it was really tasty and the fresh bread was also delicious. The portions are big the omelettes are way bigger than you would get at an English restaurant so given the portion size the price is great value. Would definitely recommend!
d8567150,October 2022,50,Lovely Dining Experience,We enjoyed the Brasserie Ambassade very much. We began in the bar and had perfectly prepared cocktails. The ambiance in the library dining room was so special and unique. Our food was delicious and we wished that we had not discovered this gem so late in our trip!
d8567150,August 2022,50,Good food,The food was very good and was at a reasonable price for quality of restaurant. Also good choice and price of wine.
d8567150,September 2022,50,Delicious,"Excellent meal in an amazing setting. Fabulous vegan option and lovely friendly staff, would definitely recommend the Zucchini."
d8567150,September 2022,30,Not good enough.,"We ordered the chicken. The menu said it came with potatoes but we were not given any. So, the two of us had a thin chicken breast with a tiny bit of lettuce and two mushrooms for 25 euros each. Laughable. It tasted nice but was not worth it. Service pleasant but our waitress seemed a bit rushed off her feet. A slightly dispiriting experience. We should’ve complained but after a tiring day we couldn’t be bothered."
d8567150,August 2022,50,Delicious food in a lovely calm environment,"We ate here in the evening as a family of four. The food was delicious - from the vegetarian main (courgette cooked many ways); the confit duck; to the children's chicken, which was succulent and accompanied by apple sauce. The staff were attentive and discreet and we had a lovely time. Well worth it and we would go again in a heartbeat."
d8567150,August 2022,50,Beautiful hotel and great service,We stayed in one of the Suoerior rooms overlooking the canal and it was great. The room was comfortable and beautifully appointed. The staff was very helpful. Can't say enough good things about the Hotel Ambassede.
d8567150,August 2022,50,Excellent all round,"Excellent food, well served and nice decor (we ate in the library area). It was so good we went back twice more."
d8567150,July 2022,50,Fantastic food,We enjoyed the wonderful food in the intimate setting of the library with a fully stocked bar. Christa provided exceptional service during our meal and Sebastian was always ready to make us a perfect drink. The food was fantastic and so convenient to return to our rooms. The hotel and Brasserie are fantastic
d8567150,August 2022,50,Great Experience,"Really nice, well located with good service and perfect rooms hotel. We stayed for 1 night. By request if there is an opportunity that can extend check out."
d8567150,August 2022,40,Worth another visit...,"Took a seat on small sidewalk terrace.  Group sitting near mme on 2 tables. Mmaybe I got mmissed as it took quite a while before I was approached. Perhaps busy inside. I just patiently enjoyed canal boaters and people wandering by.    Quick late lunch. Iced-coffee with a dusting of chocolate served with a stainless steel straw!    An arrange of beverages to choose fromm. ""Bites"" - only on mmenu such as cheese plate, snack mix, etc. I tool jalapeno bites which camme with chili sauce and pickled mmix.    They have a limmited mmenu right now as they are not currently serving lunch yet. Will have to go back then.    Restaurant gets awesomme reviews!    isabelydancer00"
d8567150,May 2022,50,Best Hotel in Amsterdam!!,We have traveled the world and this hotel is one of the best hotels we have stayed in.  The front office staff was very attentive to our every need. We were treated like royalty. Our room overlooked the canal and we could watch the boats go by all day long. Our room was very spacious was worked great for our family of four. Five star treatment right down to helping us with a bike maintenance issue with a rental bike from another business. We highly recommend this hotel.
d8567150,July 2022,50,Dine in a library!,"This restaurant is located in the hotel's library which provides a cozy environment for dining. The food is excellent, the bar is well stocked and the staff is very attentive."
d8567150,July 2022,50,"Delicious food, attentive staff, lovely view of the canal","I had dinner twice here during my stay at the hotel, and the steak frites was so good, I ordered it the second time too. I asked for the meat to be cooked medium rare and it was perfect. And the frites were some of the best I’ve had anywhere. The wait staff is professional and attentive while also being friendly and collegial. If you’re staying at the hotel, you’ll also enjoy the excellent breakfast which includes hot options cooked to order and served in the same room. (My espresso macchiato was perfect every time and by the second morning, the nice server remembered me and made it for me as soon as I came in.)"
d8567150,June 2022,50,A great restaurant,This restaurant does not disappoint. We had a great dinner during our recent visit to Amsterdam. We had dined here 3 years ago and the service and quality of food has remained stellar. If staying at the hotel the breakfast that is offered is also great.
d8567150,June 2022,50,Outstanding,"I booked the restaurant nearly 2 months before our arrival to Amsterdam, to celebrate our wedding anniversary.    The restaurant is beautiful. I specifically asked for a table near the lovely canal view to enjoy the amazing view while having dinner.    The food was outstanding, the service was great and efficient and if in Amsterdam again, I would love to go again.    General value: 10/10  Food: 10/10  Service: 10/10"
d6022573,October 2022,50,A hidden gem... worth seeking out.,"Came across this restaurant by chance, and what a find.  The choice of food was varied, and caters for those who love varying degrees of spice.  Decent size portions, delicious food,  Great staff, good price.  Make this the place to dine, when visiting Amsterdam..you won't be disappointed."
d6022573,November 2020,50,We love you Sherpa! 🤗,My partner and I are totally obsessed with Sherpa!  In a city where the indian food standard can lack... sherpa delivers top class authentic nepalese and indian food every time! We order from here once a week and it has become our weekly staple and we tell everyone that this is the spot to go to if you fancy a Nepalese or indian! Look forward to our one next week - big thanks from De Wittenkade!!!
d6022573,October 2022,50,Yummy Food with Best Service,We(with my family of 4) visited on thursday busy evening without a reservation and were accomadeted. Attentinve wait staaf and excellence typical cusines made us very satisfied.. The waiter recommended us the momos(Dumplings) and were outta this world(must try) Very much recommended...
d6022573,October 2022,50,Great meal while touring Amsterdam... NOT a tourist trap,"The food was amazing, it was our first time trying ""Momo""... I am glad the waiter recommebded it. The paneer texture and taste was perfect and the masala sauce was delicious."
d6022573,September 2022,50,Do visit,"Really delicious food. Some different dishes, incorporating Nepalese, Tibetan and Indian. Great waitress who recommended something different for us. Thoroughly enjoyed it."
d6022573,June 2022,50,"One of the best Indian in the city, if not 'the' one.","With small seating place inside, I went there in a rainy day and had to wait a bit more than my reservation time. The owners felt bad about that and kept giving me drinks outside and apologizing. I didn't mind waiting in the neighbourhood, and it worth it.    Food was just great and service was super!"
d6022573,September 2022,50,BEEESSTTT INDIAN FOOOD in Amsterdam,Amazing food Indian. Best chicken tikka and momos. We stayed 6 nights in Amsterdam and we had food here 4 times. The owner so aphable so lovable.. Much recommended.
d6022573,September 2022,50,Foodgasm,Most authentic Nepali food and vibe in Amsterdam. The people are friendly too which is a bonus to visit the place. Amazed
d6022573,September 2022,50,Super,The little hidden Gem inside busy street. Small restaurant but incredible food and service . Three courses shared dining gives tremendous taste and feelings.  Typical Nepalese cocktails are so nice . Momos are best ever I had . Recommended to have dine here in Sherpa .  Can’t wait to have dinner again !!
d6022573,September 2022,50,The food heaven,"Incredibly delicious food, very cosy atmosphere, the guys working are super friendly and caring. You feel home, super recommended!"
d6022573,September 2022,50,Fantastic food and staff,Had a delicious meal here. The staff were fantastic and the meal was incredible. One of the best curries I've ever had. Would 100% return here.
d6022573,September 2022,50,Fantastic!,Fantastic service and food! Totally Ok for a business meal. Personal are friendly and helpfull. Location is great and atmosphere is also brilliant for romantic dinners!
d6022573,September 2022,50,Best Indian food in Amsterdam,"The food and hospitality is always great. The must tries for veggies are samosa, paneer dishes and an off menu recommendation : the jeera aalu. The location is very central and the staff is very friendly and helpful"
d6022573,September 2022,50,Very good,"Very good food, very good place, very good staff. Big dishes with much food. You can choose if your food comes hot, medium or no spicy"
d6022573,September 2022,50,Great staff and quality of food!,The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. They serve the best Nepalese food of Amsterdam and have a very cosy atmosphere in their restaurant. The foods taste fresh and smells fragrant. We come here on a weekly basis. 10/10 would recommend!
d10071792,September 2022,50,Lovely dinner,This place is very cozy and a little off the beaten path but the food is amazing and the service was extremely good. Homemade pasta as good as in Italy.
d10071792,July 2022,50,Tasty birthday dinner,"Came here for a birthday dinner and had a delicious meal. Excellent food and a lovely ambiance, highly recommend for a great Italian food experience."
d10071792,May 2022,50,Food experience at La Maschera Amsterdam,Absolutely authentic and high quality Italian food. On top of that the service was just outstanding. Absolutely a must visit when in Amsterdam looking for fantastic food and a just as excellent service.
d10071792,May 2022,50,Excellent dinner.,Authentic italian cuisine and we enjoyed our meal. Easy going and cozy restaurant. Open view to kitchen and it was nice to watch how meals were prepared.
d10071792,May 2022,50,Fantastic Italian food,"Cosy restaurant, great service, delicious food and tasty wine! We had home made ravioli, one of the best pumpkin soups of my life, typical antipasti and dark gnocchi! Soooo goood!"
d10071792,May 2022,50,Delicious and friendly!,Small menu but delicious and fresh food! Very friendly service with well wine knowledge. Appreciate it!
d10071792,April 2022,50,"Great food, fast and friendly service","We really enjoyed our food and had a chat with the friendly restaurant owner, too.    Everything was well cooked, and we were so happy with the quality of food the team was able to produce considering the size of the restaurant. We had a good choice of wines and there were also some daily specials."
d10071792,April 2022,20,Non dedicated service,"We had reserved a table for 4 people. Looking forward when er arrived. The waiter several times tried to get us to order more expensive choices for starters, main and wines. E.g. Er ordered two glaces of wine (pinot grigio (8 EUR) and a ""Rosso"" blend (9 EUR)). Hej suggested a glass of Barolo for 16 EUR. When I politely insisted on my first choice, the atmosphere changed altogether and all food was served with a ""enjoy"" while walking away. Food was for all three courses, ok quality, but not more, and did not equal the relatively high Prices (and you really have to like melted mozzarella...). Many better Italian eating places in Amsterdam."
d10071792,February 2022,50,Mjammie!,Fantastic food friendly service fantastic Wines ! Typical italian style Just the way I like it! Dishes with truffle are amazing !
d10071792,December 2021,30,"Average food , overpriced , no COVID check","The food was good , however overpriced . The place could benefit from better hygiene . Quite concerning that they do not bother to follow the covid measures . We sat at the table and we were not asked for a QR check ."
d10071792,November 2021,50,Best real Italian restaurant in town!,"The food! The wines! The atmosphere! Everything is memorable. Go for a proper evening out, not for a quick bite. Indulge yourself."
d10071792,October 2021,10,"OVERPRICED, FOOD NOT EVEN AVERAGE","What a disappointment! Extremely overpriced (to the point of rudeness) and the food is just not worth it! As someone who knows Italian cuisine this was just one very bad experience! Moreover, it smells horribly inside and the placemats were dirty! The stuff is fine but not nearly enough to compensate for the rest! I really do not recommend!!!!"
d10071792,August 2021,30,Bit too much salt and a little too expensive,"Nice little restaurant in the lovely district of Jordaan. The menu is very will constructed and there were some highlights like the antipasti, however the mains were quite salty. One of the specials was the lamb balls with summer truffles for €30 and although was tasty, the portion size was more like a starter and in fact they could have been lamb balls as they were so small. Not sure if I would go back as there are better Italian restaurants in the area in my opinion."
d10071792,June 2021,10,Quality and service below par,Went to this restaurant with my wife to have a nice diner.  Unfortunately quality of the food was below expectations but the service was even worse. It was clear we were treated as ‘just tourist’ who can be served with less attention and have to leave as quickly as possible. In- and out within 30 minutes.  I don’t have a problem with paying premium prices but expect the food and service to be premium accordingly
d10071792,April 2021,50,Excellent,Exceptional. The food was very good- pasta delicious and dishes well made- incredibly fresh. The service superlative. A pleasure
d3589045,October 2022,30,Great food but lacked a personal touch,No issues with the quality of the food - every course was excellent. Unfortunately they lacked that special something. They were aware it was a birthday dinner for my partner and in an email a few days before the booking had promised a card and special small cake - but failed to deliver either on the day with a meagre verbal ‘I understand it is your birthday’ when we arrived and nothing else. A shame that a restaurant of this calibre falls short on any personal touch.
d3589045,October 2022,50,OUT OF THIS WORLD!,"I have travelled extensively and consider that I have eaten in some of the best restaurants in the world, 'SENSES' is way way up there. The quality of the food is truly exceptional. The fusion of tastes created by the chef reflects his creative imagination.  I will go back to Amsterdam, principally to taste the quality of the food again."
d3589045,October 2022,50,Wonderful birthday dinner,"We celebrated my daughters birthday with a 6 course dinner. Everyting was splendid: the quality of the dishes and the original wine pairing. Very good bread with soft butter, and all this served by enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff. Extra kudos to our sweet Swedish sommelier. This place deserves a Michelin star."
d3589045,September 2022,50,Just superb,"Amazing culinary experience, can’t rate it highly enough. Went for the All in 6 course experience with wine pairing and couldn’t fault it."
d3589045,September 2022,50,Amazing,We had an amazing dining experience. Both the food and service was excellent and we felt like we got way over our money’s worth. 6/5 stars.
d3589045,September 2022,50,Perfect!,A perfect evening with an outstanding tasting menu and service! Excellent wine and food pairings. We will definitely visit Senses again.
d3589045,September 2022,50,Tantalising tastebud experience,"An unexpected melange of courses which are explained in front of you and cooked in the kitchen in view. We had 5 courses. Well thought out small dishes that sometimes surprised my tastebuds. We did the wine flite but you really don’t have to. The venue is small & contemporary, service fast, sharp paced and attentive but if you’d rather choose your food, it’s not the place to go."
d3589045,September 2022,50,Fantastic evening.,Fantastic evening at Senses. The restaurant were very accommodating allowing us to mix different menu options amongst the six at our table. The Ultimate Senses experience was wonderful. The food a visual treat with fantastic flavours. The half glass wine pairing was a great idea allowing diners to have the full tasting experience with (a bit) more moderation. The staff were friendly and welcoming. Our sommelier was particularly enthusiastic and knowledgable. We very much enjoyed her explanations. One member of the party was unable to drink and enjoyed a lovely non alcoholic sparkling. The whole meal took all evening although we really lost track of time enjoying our seven courses. A real treat and definitely worth it.
d3589045,September 2022,50,Gourmet tasting menu in cozy relaxed atmosphere..,Small cozy and relaxed atmosphere. It doesnt have the michelin star yet but they are close i guess.. the tasting menu consists of small and gourmet selection of seafood and meat. You can choose a pairing wine menu as well. The staff is young and friendly - the service is quite fast and organized especially considering that you are having a 6-7 course menu. I an happy to have this experience. 6 course menu - 2 glasses of wine at 120 euro approx. per person
d3589045,September 2022,50,Fantastic dinner!,"Had a lovely dinner here for a birthday- great food, great service and all round a wonderful experience. The team were absolutely fantastic and really went above and beyond to make it a special evening- would absolutely recommend!"
d3589045,September 2022,50,Excelent experience,"We were in the Restaurant in 09/01/22. Since the beguining the service was perfect. We selected the 5 courses options from the menu. Each dish was better than the other.  The plates, the visual, the flavor and the appresentation were wonderfull.  It as an excellent dinner and we really recomend to be theree."
d3589045,September 2022,50,A fantastic dinner in Amsterdam,"A very creative menu, fantastic flavours and good wine matching proposal. The service was amazing; all staff were very attentive to details."
d3589045,August 2022,50,Unique style restaurant with a lot of different dishes to taste.,"Super friendly and young staff even the chef helped serving because they were short that evening. It‘s not an à la carte restaurant. You cannot choose your meal, you get a lot of special created (selected by the chef) small dishes with unique flavors to taste. Even though the dishes itself are small you get plenty of them to try so it‘s enough food. Definetly a restaurant to go to it‘s unlike normal restaurants and a marvelous experience. Highly recommend it. Little hint, if you go on your birthday you get a small dessert and a lovely birthday card to take home =D"
d3589045,August 2022,40,Small Hotel Restaurant,"All good but nothing felt unique. There is nothing to complain about, service and food was within the range what one could expect in this price segment. Do I regret having been there? No Will I go again? I dont think so"
d3589045,August 2022,50,Sensational!,"Sensational! Staff were amazing, food & wine pairings were absolute perfection, cannot recommend enough! Will definitely return next time we visit Amsterdam!"
d8528923,October 2022,30,Undeserved Michelin star…,Restaurant location on the suggestive harbour. Room on three levels large and extremely noisy ... The background music too high made it difficult to converse. Friendly but haughty and unpleasant staff. Good food but nothing special... Biblical waiting times. High price! It doesn't deserve the Michelin star.
d8528923,September 2022,50,Would dine here every evening if we could!,"This was our second trip to Amsterdam from United States, and our second trip to MOS. Nothing compares. We appreciate it even more than the most fabulous restaurants in Paris. The cuisine is exceptional. The wine steward, Henry, is the best we have encountered. The staff are personable and -- it seems -- empathic. And the ambience is what post-holiday dreams are made of. Bravo, MOS!"
d8528923,September 2022,50,"Wonderful adventure, a must visit","We had lunch at MOS, and everything about the experience was brilliant, food, service, view and space. And, we have a lot of allergies and they supported so well, adjusted so that we loved and felt safe, welcome."
d8528923,August 2022,50,Worthy of its star,"We went for an early dinner on our last day in Amsterdam,l. Very friendly welcome and service throughout. Excellent meal, the sauce with the meat was a bit too rich for my wife, but If like me you like traditional french cooking then you will enjoy it."
d8528923,July 2022,50,Near Perfection - wonderful evening of fine dining,"We were part of Viking Cruise and decided to have dinner at MOS. I reserved a table for two several weeks before leaving California. The restaurant continued to inform me of changes due to the heatwave, rare in restaurant business. Upon arrival via a taxi, a young man opened the door to welcome us, showed us to the upstairs corner table over looking the river, what a view.  Two individuals performed most of the service, a young woman and the sommelier. Unfortunately, I never got to learn about their names. Regardless, they were both professional and knowledgeable on the food and wine. The real magical show began with a few amuse bouche. They blew open my tastebuds, at the same time, beautiful to look at. Wine pairing was also near perfection. My initial thoughts were that a couple wines weren’t really fit my personal preference, but when paired with the dish, it was simply divine. A good lesson learned. Excellent service moved smoothly throughout the almost 3.5 hour meal, and wish it could be longer. All the courses were well designed and executed. Some ingredients were totally transformed into unrecognizable morsels. Super impressed. The team called us a taxi and we were ushered out to the car by the nice gentleman who assisted the team during service.  We dined in at least one Michelin starred restaurants that we visit around the world, MOS stands near the top of our list of favorites. I told the team on the way out that I would love to be dining here again, soon. Somehow, I plan to return to Amsterdam and experience another magical night.  Thank you all who were responsible to make our dinner such a memorable occasion. I will remember it for a long time."
d8528923,June 2022,50,Choose MOS!,"Great food, great ambiance. Just an all around good Michelin-star in an interesting part of Amsterdam. Good service and very conversation-friendly owner! Also offered a real nice rhum as avec which was a nice round-off to a super pleasant evening."
d8528923,May 2022,50,Very nice,"Great food, superb service and the view is wonderful. Went for our anniversary and we were very well looked after. The paired wines that we had with some of our five courses were superb. Great value given what you get."
d8528923,July 2022,50,Just delicious and great service,"A very elegant and quiet venue, on a quay overlooking the river, with parking nearby.  A very sophisticated wine list, enthousiast and knowledgeable staff. But most importantly, a very well balanced menu with an array of delicious, extremely well executed dishes. Definitely meriting it’s one Michelin star, and promising more.    We loved the whole experience, and we will be back for sure. Also a very great option for excellent business lunches."
d8528923,June 2022,50,Spectacular in every way,"This restaurant is off the charts. Worthy of a Michelin star, plus the location on the water is beautiful and the service was first rate and informative and FUN. Steve was one of the finest waitstaff I have ever had the pleasure and the owner himself was working the tables and telling great stories of the restaurant's history and food. Do not hesitate."
d8528923,June 2022,50,"Food, location, service and ambiance all top","Lucky to find a table for 6. The location is wonderful, overlooking the water and for those that arrive by car, underground parking is avialable. We were not disappointed. Service was excellent, the sommelier was very helpful and we had a truly enjoyable evening with excellent food and wine."
d8528923,June 2022,50,Wonderful Evening,Had a superb tasting menu with paired wines with great views over the Ij. The service was excellent and attentive whilst still relaxed. Thoroughly enjoyable and not as expensive as similar evenings in the UK. We will be returning to Amsterdam just for the restaurant.
d8528923,May 2022,50,What a treat,"Had a wonderful 6 course lunch here, enjoyed the 1 in a 1000 views over the Ij with boats (incl cruise liners) passing by. Wonderful selection of wines and a relaxed athmosphere."
d8528923,April 2022,50,Amazing experience!,"We came with my husband for our 4 years anniversary. We only asked for a nice table for the occasion but they even prepared a small cake in the end, very nice attention. We chose the 4 courses menu and everything was excellent. The service was also very nice and they suggested very good wines.  We really had an amazing experience and we will come back for sure during a next week-end in Amsterdam!"
d8528923,April 2022,50,Great restaurant!,"One of the best in Amsterdam, great atmosphere, excellent food and wine and perfect service. Views over the water are very nice"
d8528923,April 2022,50,An excellent meal with excellent staff,First visit to Amsterdam and so first visit to MOS. My wife and I were looking for a fine dining location and MOS fitted the bill.    An excellent meal perfectly described by the discerning staff. Rather then buy a bottle from the excellent wine list or add the pairings we decided to ask the sommelier for red and white by the glass. His choices were very good indeed. It was lovely to be able to speak to the head chef as he delivered one of the courses. The meal was well balanced and outstanding value for money.    If you are unsure where to go for fine dinning then think no longer. Choose MOS and you won't be disappointed.
d1309073,October 2022,50,Delicious brunch food,"We had brunch here after walking past it every time we were going back to the hotel and thinking how delicious the food looked.    The restaurant doesn't take bookings so you do have to queue, but we went on a weekday, around 11, and only queued for about 10 minutes which we were happy to do.    The food in question arrived really quickly and was delicious. I had the truffle benedict, which was something a bit different and would definitely recommend."
d1309073,October 2022,50,The best restaurant in Amsterdam,"I went to Amsterdam 4 times and this is one of the best restaurant there I assure you, the customer service is amazing the staff is very friendly and the food is mwah delicious hands up to the amazing manger and everyone else."
d1309073,October 2022,50,Cozy and delicious,Great location along one of the canals. Cozy little place with excellent food. I had the special with poached egg on asparagus and beets which was incredible. My wife had the French toast and loved it.
d1309073,September 2022,50,Excellent,Delicious brunch menu. Nice staff. Cosy environment. Little waiting time. Very close to the center without the crowds.
d1309073,September 2022,50,Delicious breakfast,Very nice and warm place to have breakfast. Eggs benedict and banana bread were great! If you go early you can easily find a table. Otherwise you need to wait a bit. But it worths!
d1309073,September 2022,50,Best breakfast in Amsterdam,Must try!! Best egg Benedict in Amsterdam Service is excellent and food is spectacular I never miss it whenever I’m traveling.
d1309073,September 2022,40,Overdone,"Friends of ours insisted that Greenwoods offers the best breakfast in the area, and so it probably does, IF you want to have an English-style breakfast. I'm less of a fan, preferring the Dutch style, but after the sausage, back bacon, two eggs and the trimmings, you won't leave feeling hungry. The servings of coffee are small and expensive."
d1309073,September 2022,50,Great breakfast,"I did a quick Google maps search of breakfast restaurants located close to my hotel when visiting Amsterdam and this place came up. The reviews were good and the menu looked good as well. Got sat relatively quickly though noticed a line form after us. Cappuccinos we’re excellent and the food was delicious. I ordered the regular eggs Benedict. Everything was so fresh, the eggs cooked perfectly. My husband got the Benedict Royal. Also delicious. We would definitely go back the next time we’re here!"
d1309073,September 2022,50,Perfectly delightful,"Delightful meals , we enjoyed two occasions here . Lovely staff , great atmosphere and beautiful food . The setting is perfect but both our visits were sunny days . I imagine it’s pretty intimate on a rainy day but I can’t say."
d1309073,September 2022,50,Great experience and food!!,"I really enjoyed it, you should try this place! Cosy place, the menu is complete, the service is pleasant,"
d1309073,September 2022,50,Vegan Burger was Good!,"I really enjoyed the Vegan Burger (I’m not Vegan but don’t eat breakfast meats). It was, however, more of a sweet potato burger. Still it was tasty and nicely prepared!"
d1309073,September 2022,50,Great atmosphere and really nice food,Visited in the morning with family to get some scrambled eggs. Greeted with super friendly and smiling staff. Waited 10 minutes for the table as the restaurant gets very busy. The food was good and would go back and can recommend it for visiting.
d1309073,August 2022,50,Great way to start the day.,Delicious and well worth the visit. Eggs were perfect and pancakes to die for. Great atmosphere. Would definitely visit again.
d1309073,August 2022,50,Delicious and colourful food,"Excellent place. Bit expensive but it's absolutely worth it. This guy's are making art there. Would recommend it, specially with friends."
d1309073,August 2022,50,Amazing breakfast,"This place is a much for breakfast. You will need to book as it gets very busy. The eggs Royal and the eggs bendict truffle were amazing, lovely fresh orange juice. The staff are very friendly."
d2315768,September 2022,50,Amsterdam at its finest,"Last meal in Amsterdam was a total blast. Utterly blown away by the level of attention to details & sustainability code of conduct at @restaurant.flore.    2 Michelin ⭐️⭐️ as well as 1 Michelin showcase nothing but pure magic inside the walls of the new reopened Dutch extravaganza.    Sea snails, cuttlefish, escargots, the most beautiful indulging cooked veggies and one of the best sourdough I ever tried, topped off with silky homemade oregano oil.    The front of house service was on point throughout the night and very helpful with tons of information about the concept, the project and the questions that had arise during dinner. Very well trained and top notch in terms of professionalism.    It is certain that Amsterdam’s dining scene can easily be compared to the great gastronomic getaways of the world, living in a future of culinary respect, evolution and imagination. Well done, guys. Nothing but pure appreciation towards you all."
d2315768,May 2022,50,Superb,"Absolutely outstanding. Food quality, creativity, presentation, superb wine pairing, excellent staff. Do not miss Flore! We enjoyed a 5-hour dinner; highlight of our trip. Experience matched a 2-star Michelin."
d2315768,November 2021,50,Great evening,"We had an absolutely amazing experience here. The food was so good and the service was spectacular. The service here was unreal too, I can't recommend this restaurant enough. It is a must try spot!"
d2315768,October 2021,20,Food is not tasty. Very slow,Food is not tasty. Very slow service. High price. I cannot recommend this place for a good time with your friends or family.
d2315768,September 2021,10,Extremely ridiculous!,So you want to plan a special evening for a special person…. Booked a table and was notified that I had to pay €200 per person in order to finalize the booking! You have got to be kidding! This is so utterly outrageous I will refuse to eat there!
d2315768,August 2020,50,More than what we expected (from reviews),"Professional, diligent service. Surprising, excellent amuses before the diner had begun and even after!  Definitely returning with good friends or family.  Thank you so much for an unforgettable, mouth-watering evening :-)"
d2315768,January 2020,50,Loved every little bit!!!,"Came here while visiting our friends in town. Impeccable white glove service but without the stuffiness. In fact the staff were so friendly and hilarious we’d come back just for the service! Dinner was also an amazing adventure of flavors and textures, and we’d highly recommend the wine pairing. The view at night was also superb. Very thoughtfully curated restaurant experience. Would visit again!"
d2315768,May 2019,50,Delicate & modern Dutch fine dinning,"We enjoyed Bor’deaux On the last night of our stay at hotel de L’Europe, and one might say best for last. I don’t know if the dining room was so intimate and spacious because there weren’t a lot of reservations that evening, but there was a lot of space in between tables giving a nice feel of privacy. This is much more of a low-key and quiet restaurant than a glitzy restaurant. The quality of the food and the quality of the service makes up for the quiet atmosphere. Play full dishes and presentations, inspired cocktail selection which I enjoyed two of. I would definitely recommend this one Michelin star restaurant if you’re looking for some of the best local cuisine in Amsterdam in a quiet environment."
d2315768,October 2019,50,Original Amsterdam luxury,Elegant and classic fine dining. Michelin-starred restaurant in Amsterdam’s historic centre. Honoured by Wine Spectator 2018 for having one of the most outstanding restaurant wine lists in the world.
d2315768,November 2019,50,Above and beyond,"Dined at Bord’eau with my boyfriend and another couple. We each had the six-course menu with wine pairings. The food was simply sublime. Particular favorites at our table were a lamb heart amuse bouche, oyster and sea vegetables, partridge, langostino, venison, and hare. The night was made all the more magical thanks to our server, Mai, and the sommelier, Thijs. Thanks for an unforgettable evening — and for putting up with us after the wine hit us all a couple courses in."
d2315768,October 2019,40,Best brioche I’ve had + magnificent view,"Comprehensive wine selection, impeccable service and delicious food. Didn’t get the tasting menu because I was too full, 3 starters and 1 main course shared upon 2 people was a good choice."
d2315768,September 2019,50,Superb,"4 of us ate here for my wife’s birthday this weekend.    Firstly, the position is wonderful. We chose to eat outside having first noticed the restaurant while walking across the bridge opposite. The tables are laid out right next to the canal and enjoy lovely views.    The food And wine were excellent. 2 of us enjoyed beautifully cooked fish dishes and the other 2 enjoyed different cuts of steak which included good cuts of meat that were cooked to perfection. The prices are certainly not cheap here however for the quality of food you receive, I would consider that the prices are pitched about right and are appropriate versus other high quality venues we’ve visited in the past. In fact, the quality of food and service were significantly better than some venues for which we’ve paid much higher prices.    What really set this place apart for us though was the service. The staff were attentive without being invasive and demonstrated throughout that they really cared about our experience. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble. By way of example we changed table twice during the meal however I must stress that this was in no way due to any complaint or defect. In fact it was because there was a storm on its way! The staff had been watching the forecast and we were informed of the storm before ordering and given the choice of moving inside or to another table with more cover but we chose to remain at our initial table for the first course. When the winds arrived we then moved to another outside table which was under a little move cover and the staff kindly provided blankets for us so we could continue to enjoy our outside location. There was then a significant downpour so we then moved to an inside table and were each personally escorted with umbrellas.    To breakdown my rating I’ve given maximum available *s for all aspects of the experience but in all honesty I would give the staff many more, if they were available."
d2315768,July 2019,40,Great food and nice view,Inside on a rainy evening and still sitting on the edge og one of Amsterdam's many canals - not a bad start. Staff and food was excellent - can only recommend this nice restaurant.
d2315768,May 2019,30,They need to improve to keep their rating.,One Michelin star but neither the food nor the service matched that rating. The price was too high for what they offered.
d2315768,June 2019,50,Excellent service and food,a real culinary experience to a very reasonable price. Service was excellent. Food was creative and very tasty. Wine pairing worked very well. And the staff really tried to accomodate every wish we had to adjust the menu to our wishes. Highly recommended!
d4177229,September 2022,50,Egg cellent place for lunch.,"Excellent food, buzzy atmosphere and really friendly staff. Great for meat eaters and vegetarians with a very wide choice of options."
d4177229,July 2022,40,Good local joint for breakfast/brunch,"Brought here by a local friend we were spending the day with, this is one of her go-to spots for brunch with friends in the neighborhood. As the name would suggest, omelettes are their specialty but there are other options as well. A large menu with many options but many are very interesting. I went with the El Chorizo with spicy chorizo, mushroom, onion and farmer cheese. Jen went with the gorgonzola bacon with sun-dried tomatoes, chive and oregano. The flavor of them both was excellent and the size was sufficient to last several hours of wandering around Amsterdam."
d4177229,August 2022,50,10 out of 10,"The food was amazing, the taste was exquisite. It did not disappoint. I'd recommend the Scramble Royale & fresh pressed apple juice."
d4177229,August 2022,40,Great eggs…great service!,Atmosphere really good and the food is great! We had a Omelette and build your own. Big potions and very tasty. Good breakfast!
d4177229,July 2022,50,Par Excellance!,"There are scrambled eggs and then there are the eggs served at Omelegg! We had eaten at Omelegg in 2016 and were ecstatic when we found it again in July, 2022. The scrambled eggs were as rich as we had remembered. The croissants were just as light. And the prices were still reasonable. What more could we ask for? Wonderful, personal service. Great!"
d4177229,July 2022,20,VERY slow and unapologetic service completely ruins the experience.,"The food here is above average - an omelet isn't the easiest dish to get wrong, and the choice is large. But you will wait a LONG time for coffee and drinks, which will usually arrive long after you've finished eating. Of all meals, breakfast should be immediate. Coffee should arrive instantly. OJ should be readily available. And butter and/or jam should be provided without asking."
d4177229,July 2022,50,Tasty af,"We orderd omelettes, and it was the best omelette we have ever tasted! Want an incredible breakfast? Go here!!!! Will most likely go here every day next time im here."
d4177229,July 2022,40,Good breakfast spot - So many omelet choices!,You can really get a good omelet here with a wide selection. I tried the Halloumi with avocado. The taste is great but it was also a bit watery. The service was friendly and fast so that was nice. Would recommend
d4177229,July 2022,50,Great breakfast choice!,"We arrived early at 7:10 hoping to beat the crowd. Only 2 people were in the restaurant when we arrived, but many more arrived before we left. Service was friendly, efficient, and accommodating to English. We had the Greek and the Italian job omelettes. We enjoyed them both. Omelettes were served with salad and fresh bread. Highly recommend a visit!"
d4177229,May 2022,50,Want a good breakfast- visit this place,"Great place for breakfast, good quality and very reasonable prices.. Friendly staff.. we found recommendation on trip advisory and it didn’t disappoint…. Variety of choices for omelettes, you can crate your own as well, freshly squished orange juice and a good coffee"
d4177229,April 2022,50,Best Breakfast,"The food is so good.  Its made infront of you , so fresh, healthy and the quality is just divine.  The staff are friendly. You can see they work hard, they do not stop.  down side is be prepared to Que, also if you are a celiac, they use the same toaster for gluten free bread as normal bread which is a bit ofna let down. Portion sizes are amazing though. ❤"
d4177229,April 2022,50,Great place for bruch!,I had this wonderful meal with my friend when we visited Amsterdam. The place was so nice and warm and the dishes we ordered were terrific. Let's just say that even vegetables are delicious for a meat lover like me😘
d4177229,February 2022,20,Not for me,"Went to this place on our first morning. We were going on a tour so it was early and they were open. Nice small cosy place with a very pleasant waitress but our breakfast was cold, the eggs were rubbery and the sausage was barely cooked. When we left we went to a different place for a pancake as we weren’t full for our day ahead. Wouldn’t try it again."
d4177229,October 2021,40,It is what it says,The omelettes were tasty and the stuff was friendly and kind. Not the best breakfast place in Amsterdam but worth maybe a visit!
d4177229,September 2021,50,Cute place not too far from the central station,"Fantastic place to eat! It was so popular that there was a queue outside, but it was definitely worth waiting for. The food was delicious and the staff was friendly. Especially the new Spanish girl. It looks good too. If you're looking for a nice place for a date, this could be a nice option."
d3198485,August 2022,50,Exquisite dinning,"Perfect ambience, perfect food, perfect hospitality.. simply exquisite, we dinned here on my girlfriend’s birthday and the whole experience was just great"
d3198485,June 2022,50,Absolutely perfect barbecue!,"The food was absolutely delicious! We ordered side salads, Roast Pork Ribs and Lamb. The pork and lamb were perfectly barbecued with just the right amount of smokey flavour. The salads, fries and sauces the came with the meals were excellent too. It was a great night!"
d3198485,May 2022,50,Delicious Chateaubriand,"Very small, intimate venue. We were placed by the door at first, but asked to get moved when possible and our waiter fulfilled this request swiftly. Very fast, pleasant service. Delicious Rioja, Chateaubriand and Creme Brulee. Waiter was also helpful with recommending bars we could go to. Great trip and good value."
d3198485,May 2022,40,enjoyable,"The title "" brasserie "" conveys a lot about the style and ambiance and food aspirations of the restaurant .Clearly very busy and successful .Menu not trying to be too clever and focussing on fairly simple courses cooked well ..which they were . Dessert of three kinds of ice cream less successful ..overly sweet and all varieties almost indistinguishable .Service very pleasant and welcoming"
d3198485,May 2022,50,Nice place for a special dinner,"Lovely food and wine here. Must order the chateaubriand - delicious! Really enjoyed eating at one of their outdoor tables on a warm night. Quite an expensive evening, but everything did seem very high quality."
d3198485,April 2022,50,Very nice,"All food was good. There is a focus on meat but good fish and veggie options too. Don’t skip the starters, they were really excellent. We had a great table by the front window, looking out on a quiet, pretty street."
d3198485,October 2021,50,Perfect!,"Lovely little restaurant, great atmosphere and fabulous service. The food was spectacular, we had the chateaubriand and the snicker ice cream mousse for dessert and they were both so so good! Would definitely recommend and will definitely be back :)"
d3198485,October 2021,40,Cozy place with good food,We we a group of 10 people and we were told that not all dishes could be ordered because we were to big a group. We all ordered chateaubriand and it was a very good meal. Good selection of wines and very friendly waiter. It feels like a family place with good atmosphere.
d3198485,October 2021,50,Last night back in Europe...great way to end!,"My son decided we need to have one more night of French bistro food....no complaints here. This place was excellent. We had the Bao Bun pork appetizer and it was amazing....truly so. For mains, my son had the best lamb meal I have ever tasted. I had the pork loin and though very good could have cooked 2 minutes less. Desserts were excellent as well. Wine list was solid with lots of good options at good price points. Service was also excellent.    We will say we had a bit of food envy when we saw the shared steak plates go by.....looked awesome....but this just gives us another reason to go back in the future."
d3198485,September 2021,50,Do not hesitate....just go there and enjoy !,"Very good food within a very nice, cosy environment with very friendly personnel. So do not think and just go there to experience it !"
d3198485,September 2021,50,Highly Recommend,Had a great meal hear last week. Had the Lamb & Frites and it was spectacular. Nice spot in a great neibourhood.
d3198485,September 2021,50,Best meat,"Amazing meat and very good service…! We choose the feast aurante based on the review and it keep our expectations..! The meat was simply special combined with different sauces, good selection of wine and fair price…!! Recommend..!"
d3198485,August 2021,50,"Great service, delicious food","Can't believe we've only just found this place, it's been here 11 years. (Not on a main street, I think that's why.) Just super friendly and helpful, food some of the best pasta I've ever had."
d3198485,June 2021,50,Very recommended,"Delicious food- the meat was excellent and also the dessert. great service, it was a very very nice place"
d3198485,April 2021,50,Fantastic,Fantastic. What a wonderful way of returning to a restaurant after months of lockdown. Great food and great service. Reasonable value for money
d2292732,September 2022,20,Meh,We were looking for a place to eat while it was raining. Table for two. We had no reservation and the first thing staff said to us we had to leave in an hour... then they didnt take our order for about 35 mins. We ordered the taster platter for two. The food was mediocre and it turned out there were plenty tables free even by the time we were meant to leave. The bill was incredibly high and they even wanted to try and charge us more. Cannot recommend at all. Small space and therefore very noisy as too many tables are crammed in.
d2292732,September 2022,50,Fabulous Indonesian Restaurant!,What a treasure! Impeccable food and service!! We tried it all and loved everything even my usually picky husband!! Make sure to make a reservation or get there early in case of a cancellation! One of the BEST restaurants in Amsterdam!
d2292732,September 2022,50,Fantastic restaurant and very nice atmosphere,"Ouaaaah ! Five stars restaurant, welcome, food, service. Our hotel INK booked a table for us telling that we would be very pleased. The space is friendly, the welcome is warm and the owner, Max, is a great, nice and very professional person. The food was just great and the service perfect. If you like Indonesian food, just book and go !"
d2292732,September 2022,40,Good modern asian food,We had the taster menu of which allergies were easily accomodated. The good is all of good quality and value. The place is very busy do reservations recommended.
d2292732,August 2022,20,"Poor experience, not real 'indonesian'","Horrible experience. The rijsttafel option is not real indonesian, but a look a like tourist dish. The next day after max we went to another (less touristy) place and there we experienced the REAL rijsttafel experience. Never again."
d2292732,August 2022,50,Innovative Indonesian cuisine in a friendly setting.,Innovative Indonesian cuisine in a friendly setting. Just west of Herengracht Canal and just east of Jordaan neighborhood.
d2292732,September 2022,40,Worth the flight from Canada !,"Excellent updated take on rystaffel . Fresh , beautifully presented . Vegetarian options Staff were wonderful. Definitely worth a visit ."
d2292732,August 2022,10,Would NOT recommend...,MAX restaurant is everything but a nice indonesian restuarant. The cooks are from turkey and the food is not authentic. It is overpriced in every way and the staff is rude. Avoid!
d2292732,September 2022,50,Wow. Just wow.,"I visited Max (again) with a mix of customers and colleagues. None had been to Max's restaurant before but every one of them loved it. The food (sublime), the service (exceptional) and the atmosphere (great fun and completely relaxed) made for a very, very special evening. Max and team, thank you, all of you. I have no doubt that you will be seeing some of those faces again."
d2292732,September 2022,50,Looking for delicious Indonesian - go to Max Amsterdam,"￼    Friends and I sought this restaurant out because of the great reviews from past patrons. We made a reservation online before leaving Canada and I recommend you do the same so you're not disappointed because the restaurant is small. We were not disappointed! We had their signature meal, Rijsttafel, and every dish served was fabulous. If you choose to go here, and you should, it is a little hard to find. Their sign is only on the wall, nothing hanging over the entrance, and a folding table was leaning against and covering most of it. But it was worth the persistence."
d2292732,September 2022,50,Favorite Restaurant in Amsterdam,"Max is a delight. Elegant and high-quality food with an Indonesian influence and a charming Chef/owner. I visit Amsterdam annually and this my go to spot for an incredible meal! You can't go wrong at Restaurant Max, and if you can't decide what to order, just ask the staff. Enjoy!"
d2292732,September 2022,40,Great Evening with Good Food,"We were in Amsterdam as a company for the annual IBC Show and we were looking for something a bit different to the restaurants we normally go to and we found this restaurant and manged to get a reservation for 10 people.  The staff were friendly and attentive even though they were very busy and nothing was too much for them.  We opted for the taster plates menu, and the food was well cooked, hot and extremely tasty. We had a member of the party with an allergy to one of the items on the plate and they were more than willing to swap items to accommodate them  All in all a good dining experience and one which I would recommend to friends and colleagues"
d2292732,August 2022,50,Delicious,We enjoyed a delicious meal with a taste of lots of different small plates- the gado gado was gorgeous. Friendly and efficient staff- highly recommended
d2292732,August 2022,50,Dinner for 6,"Had an incredible meal at this restaurant and this was our favorite dinner of our three nights we were in Amsterdam. At the recommendation of our waiter, we chose the 6 course tasting menu which got us a wide variety of food that was all delicious. Overall, great atmosphere and would love to come back in the future!"
d2292732,August 2022,50,Unique dinning experience in Amsterdam,"Our first visit to Amsterdam and first taste of Rijsttafel(Rice Table), which is unforgettable experience. We ordered 3 courses, and really enjoyed the food. Service was very good. We were late for our reservation due to train delay. Max was so nice to hold the table for us, even though it’s very busy. We will be back if visiting Amsterdam again."
d2072803,September 2022,50,Great food /friendly service AMAZING,"Great food , friendly customer service the chef was also paying attention what the tables were having , the owner came and looked after us and also the waitress Vanesa was so friendly  Really good meat soft and the chimichurri OMG , they didn’t have sangria but you can also make it your self with wi e and Fanta(not the same of course) but they were happy to give us ice and bigger glasses over all amazing"
d2072803,September 2022,50,Gorgeous meal in lovely area of Amsterdam,"My Partner and I came here for a meal while in Amsterdam after I found it was one of trip advisors top rated steak restaurants and it did not disappoint.    We were about 15/20 mins early for our booking but were seated no problem. The staff were very friendly and our waiter was more than happy to attempt in assisting us with ordering.    We received complimentary bread with garlic butter. We then both had 350grams of Argentinian steak which comes with your choice of sauce and baked potato or chips. We had a bottle of red wine too.    We had hoped to get a seat outside after our meal to finish our wine as it was extremely warm during our trip and the restaurant is small inside but there is limited seating outside. One of the waitresses did go to the effort of asking people sitting outside if they wanted to swap with us, sadly no one did but we appreciated the fact she tried!    I would definitely recommend this restaurant. This area of Amsterdam is lovely too with a few bars dotted around the canals and outside seating. It’s about a 10 minute walk from Amsterdam Central."
d2072803,August 2022,50,Simply great steaks,"Great atmosphere, really friendly helpful staff, and scrumptious steaks. When you simply need a good steak, Luna is the destination in Amsterdam. After lots of holiday food, a delicious steak and simple but tasty sides were just what we needed. I’m gluten free and the staff were helpful and accommodating, but not specified on the menu."
d2072803,July 2022,50,Possibly the best Steak Restaurant in Amsterdam.,"There are loads of places to get a steak in Amsterdam, but if you want to avoid the chain Restaurants and go somewhere more personal, where they care about the food and wine they are serving, you cannot beat this place. And it's amazing value.  we had a tasting plate, of four steaks from around the world and it was an excellent education for me and my steak loving son.  (If you want the best steak here, and don't want to try them all, go for South American. Just lovely.  My only slight negative was the chips/fries. Not great, rather dry but made up for by the excellent wines.  Do not hesitate. Go here, if you can get a table."
d2072803,July 2022,50,Fantastic,"Fantastic sausages and steaks, quite a bargain. The staff were very friendly and gave us a table although we didn't make a reservation in advance. We will definitely come back."
d2072803,July 2022,50,Fantastic food and experience!,"A must visit whilst in Amsterdam - I chose to dine at this restaurant on the last day of my trip and I wasn't disappointed. The restaurant is based in a quiet side street, and has a great atmosphere. I asked the waitress for recommendations and she was helpful and upbeat. The food itself was delicious and I would highly recommend you visit this restaurant."
d2072803,February 2022,50,Wonderful food and great staff!,Great food and wonderful atmosphere! Perfectly prepared meat and beautiful presentation on a small grill on your own table. They have great wines and very tasteful desserts! The staff is very friendly and helpful. A wonderful place to have a nice evening! I would definitely recommend!
d2072803,February 2022,50,Great food and atmosphere!,"Restaurant luna gave us an awesome evening! They have wonderful food, the meat is really tender and they serve it with a really tasteful chimichurri sauce! The fries and vegetables are perfect. One of us has a gluten intolerance and the staff was really helpful explaining what we could and couldn’t eat! And they have allot of gluten-free options! Great ambiance and food with live music and very friendly staff!"
d2072803,January 2022,50,Very good restaurant!!,"The food was very good, the staff friendly and the inn is nicely furnished. Gladly again. ........... ................"
d2072803,July 2021,50,great lunch,"I was here (only) for a empanadas lunch. Great taste! Great atmosphere, nice people, great wine. Brought me back to my visits to South America. Can’t wait to come back to taste the steaks for dinner."
d2072803,July 2021,50,Luna restaurant amsterdam,The best meal we have had in Amsterdam. Delicious and tender meat. We were surprised to receive an excellent entrance offered. Staff extremely courteous and friendly. Excellent quality-price ratio
d2072803,November 2020,50,"Excellent service, food and","Excellent service, food and charming atmosphere. Excellent steaks, appetizers and side dishes.  Outstanding service by Claudia, Aftab, Chef Laura and Chef Tom.  OUTSTANDING SERVICE AND DINNER"
d2072803,October 2020,50,Meat overdose,"Amazing place for delicious meat cravers,went for the mixed platter to try them all and it was exquisite! Definitely recommended,staff was so friendly and service was amazing"
d2072803,September 2020,50,Early dinner,"100% recommend! Omg by far my favorite restaurant of our Amsterdam trip. I had the Argentinian steak med/rare and my boyfriend had the Brazilian steak med/well done, both cooked beautifully, we arrived before it opened and didn't realize until we walked in, the owner made us feel comfortable and wouldn't let us leave and come back later, very welcoming. If we weren't leaving today I would come back for sure."
d2072803,September 2020,50,Amazing food and friendly staff,"Amazing food and friendly service. Went with the 4 regional steaks and each where fantastic, delicious and high quality. The food is very reasonable and one of the best steaks I’ve ever had. Highly recommended and will return next time I’m back"
d2265132,October 2022,40,Delicious hamburgers,"Visited in Lombardos and had a hamburger with fries and a can of coke. The whole portion was delicisious and worth of money, really! There is under ten place to sit so quite many of the customers is having a take a way, I think."
d2265132,October 2022,50,Best burger in Ámsterdam,Attendant was very kind and have me good hints about the menu. The burger was really fantastic... The best one in Ámsterdam
d2265132,September 2022,10,Excellent burgers but the manager (?) is a rude arrogant cnt,"Absolutely amazing burgers, really high quality, and very creative, too. The staff, in general, are also very friendly, with some very noticeable exceptions. But communication with customers is a disaster. When orders online are made, there's a 50% risk you will never get your food, and they will not even inform you. When informed about anything not working / problems, they are never interested in using the feedback and repairing anything, their attitude is ""yeah, yeah, *** you, we have a lot of traffic anyway"". The last straw: I and many other people couldn't reach them by phone for over a month; I try to help companies I like to get better, and solve their issues - I called the owner/manager/business contact. There were basically two types of reactions possible: either getting concerned by the fact nobody out of dozen people couldn't reach them - or showing how much they did not give a ***. They chose the latter, and in the rudest way possible. Even though I explained clearly and politely why and with what problem I called, the person on the other end kept asking impatiently ""why are you calling me?!"" - and then just hung up. I am absolutely disgusted with this sort of behaviour. As much as I love their burgers, this attitude is absolutely outrageous. I have brought them over a dozen of new customers. Now I am going to warn them - like I warn you - how Lombardo's manages problem reports. There is also an absurdly humoristic accent to it: when I told the person I was about to publish an appropriate review, he wrote ""I don't want your review"" and called me ""super rude""! :D Did he authentically think this would convince me not to publish?"
d2265132,August 2022,50,"Excellent experience, amazing burger","Extremely friendly staff, amazing service. I am mostly impressed with the “El Chapo” burger and the overall efficiency of the experience. We were absolutely starving and the food was not only quick, it was also delicious. Will definitely come back here when in Amsterdam!"
d2265132,June 2022,50,Juicy lunch,"I love its juicy sandwiches. It's perfect. You should try it after some hours of work, as a lunch. I also like the location of the shop. It has lots of amazing markets."
d2265132,March 2022,40,The place and atmosphere are very unique- so it is part of the specialty...,"The facilities inside the restaurant are very modest. The room and space are very limited and the menue is outside ( why??!)    The burger was very good!, but the dish comes with nothing on the side.... if I was very hungry It wouldn't be enough for me...."
d2265132,March 2022,50,One of the best burgers!,Came across this place by chance and the decision to go inside proved to be the right one.  I had one of the best burgers I’ve ever had to the sound of a really funky soundtrack.  Would love to come back!  Only problem for me is that it doesn’t have a toilet!
d2265132,December 2021,20,Not recommend,"Food has no taste Burgers are very dry I ordered cheesiest burger that they had There was almost no cheese Chicken sandwich with cheapest chicken part , looks not tasty at all , we even decided to not try it Disappointed Not recommend"
d2265132,November 2021,50,10/10,Top 3 burgers I’ve ever had. Fantastic quality and presentation. I had the wagyu burger which was €20 and my partner got a basic classic burger for €10
d2265132,September 2021,50,Superb,"One of the best burgers i have had in Europe, top that with an extremely welcoming staff and that is the recipe for a superb place to visit. Thanks to Mr.Andrew, i hope to revisit the place in my next visit."
d2265132,August 2021,50,Excellent,"One of the best hamburger that I had in all my life, waiters are very friendly, service very quick and portions are very generous."
d2265132,September 2020,50,Best meal we've had so far in Amsterdam,"We don't eat meat very often, so when we do, we are pretty fussy about it. All the meat on Lombardo's menu is grass fed/free range and marinated and grilled to perfection!    My husband had the classic lamb burger and claims it to be the best burger he has ever had. The smashed potatoes were so buttery and flavourful, soft and fluffy on the inside, slightly crisp on the outside... Just amazing."
d2265132,July 2020,50,Crazy Delicious,"Best burger I had in a long time. They offer a variety of fricking delicious burgers. Price is fine, staff is friendly. Must Go!"
d2265132,June 2020,50,By miles away the best burger,"By miles away the best burger in town, never disappointed, great people, great food. Must do when here. 👌👌👌"
d2265132,December 2019,50,Great burger by global standards,"When I went to Lombardo’s I had been living in West Africa for more than a year. And that’s not a great region for burgers. The burgers at Lombardo’s are excellent. I especially like the USA Wagyu and the El Chapo Cartel Burger. The Wagyu really emphasizes the flavor of the beef. The El Chapo is like a symphony of flavor. The jalapeño, the avocado, the horse radish sauce, the cheese...it all goes together so well. These people are burger craftsmen."
d2006595,October 2022,40,Great service,Stephanos was an excellent server. All of his recommendations were excellent. Make sure you get a reservation for weekends!
d2006595,October 2022,50,Fantastic experience,"It's been a fantastic experience at Midtown Grill in Amsterdam. The steak was perfectly cooked and the service courteous and attentive. Special thanks to Hang, Armando, Thomas, Daria and Antonio."
d2006595,October 2022,50,Thank you Hang,"Had an excellent experience in Marriott hotel restaurant for a buffet breakfast. wonderful food selection, but more impressive was the wonderful service from our service provider Ms. Hang and Daria. Although there is a big group of us, they are always full of smiles, very friendly and attentive to our needs. One could just feel the genuineness in their service level and professionalism. Thank you very much Ms. Hang and Daria."
d2006595,October 2022,50,First time here but not the last time…,"First time but not last time!  Living already for about 10 years in Amsterdam but it was our first visit at midtown grill. The least that we can say is that our dinner experience exceeded our expectations.  We were nicely and warmly welcome by Ruben who gave us a romantic table. Then, our waitress Kelly took great care of us, full of attention.  Not to forget the meat that was delicious, perfectly cooked by the chef Leo, and not too fatty, simply juicy.  We’ll definitely come back."
d2006595,October 2022,50,Still the best,"Been to midtown grill before and the service gets better everytime. Orhan is thoughtful explains everything about the meat, food and give handy tips to create the best experience. The chef Antonio made a exquisite lobster and filet mignon to die for. Midtown grill is a must for everyone visiting Amsterdam."
d2006595,October 2022,50,Birthday celebration,"We had such a great experience at Midtown Grill. The steak cooked by Chef Antonio was phenomenal, the best steak I have ever had! The cheesecake was delicious. Our server Kelly provided a great service. Would highly recommend Midtown Grill."
d2006595,October 2022,50,The best food we had in Amsterdam!,"I booked this restaurant for my boyfriends birthday meal & was super impressed with the delicious food and friendly, welcoming service.    Claudia, our server, was extremely knowledgeable and helpful.    The food was out of this world, the best steak I’ve ever had. A special birthday dessert was provided and a keepsake photo taken. Claudia even accommodated us and took a second when my boyfriend wasn’t pleased with the first she really went above and beyond to make us happy and my boyfriend feel special on his birthday.    1000% recommend eating here and will definitely visit again when back in Amsterdam."
d2006595,October 2022,50,Bday,"The place is chill and elegant. From the reception - thanks to Claudia - to the table, everything is perfect. The dinner in two for bday was stunning. Kelly helped us with choosing steaks and wine and we would like to thank Chef Angie for the absolutely delicious steaks. Overall a very superb evening with very nice decor and above and beyond staff. Thank you"
d2006595,October 2022,50,Elegant place with amazing stakes!,"Very elegant place with great service and amazing food. I would recommend if you feel like having a nice romantic dinner. ❤️ Special thank you to Claudia, Kelly and Chef Angie!"
d2006595,October 2022,50,Great experience,Midtown Grill was awesome. Food was great. Steaks were perfect. Staff was outstanding. Not a single complaint.
d2006595,October 2022,50,Delicious food and hospitality,"Gone was the server who helped me and was so nice and attentions! The food prepared by chef João was delicious, and at the end, voila…a surprise with marshmallows !!! Great experience !"
d2006595,October 2022,50,"Excellent and pleasant svc,food is not bad too","Excellent service by the staff.  Went for breakfast buffet with 3 other colleagues.  Was served by Hang and Miriam.  Both ladies was greatly helpful and friendly.Very pleasant and prompt in their service.Ensured our drinks are all topped up and constantly checked on us.  The food was not bad,the standard breakfast offering with 04 style of omelette,fruits yogurt breads salad.  Hours are 0630-1100"
d2006595,October 2022,50,Midtown Grill-Amsterdam,"A definite must try, especially for meat lovers out there.This place will go down our Amsterdam highlights.  We were walking by the streets when the colorful murals and beautiful interior caught our eye. We were lucky enough to find a same day spot.    And what an experience! Impeccable service, professional, knowledgeable and friendly staff especially Claudia who was assisting us tonight. She made sure everything was just perfect, explained the concept, and gave us an elaborate and detailed description of all the meat cuts and recommended her favorite. She was always around and attentive. Hats off to Lucas, the chef. All the dishes hit the spot and made this dinner extra special. We went for the local filet mignon which was perfectly cooked alongside mouthwatering portobello mushrooms and grilled vegetables. Do not forget to side your piece of meat with Béarnaise sauce.    The NY cheesecake was just perfect for our sweet tooth. The sweetness balanced by the strawberry coulis and rich cheese topping.    We will definitely be back next time we are in Amsterdam!"
d2006595,September 2022,50,Delicious dinner with high quality,Very nice place with cozy interior. Absolutely perfect service and very good food. Nice that they brought the meat cart and explained the difference between the different cuts of meat.
d2006595,October 2022,50,Wonderful Mid town grill experience,"Our family of 4 had dinner at Midtown Grill. Our server, Claudia, was incredibly friendly and welcoming. She took the time to explain all the different types of steak available. Thanks to Maria, the chef, we had some deliciously cooked steak. We also loved the Mac and cheese on the side (highly recommend!). We rounded off the meal with some on-the-house marshmallows. The experience was lovely and we’ll definitely come back when we visit Amsterdam again."
d4203545,July 2022,50,ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING,"A great meal So good Risotto with langoustines ,courgettes and pine nuts Followed by the most wonderful semifreddo Nd the obligatory grappa Magnificent Thanks Fabio"
d4203545,July 2022,50,Great Restaurant - Highly Recommended,"Visited this restaurant twice during a five day stay in Amsterdam as it was so good. Really delicious food and wine, great value for money and excellent service. The pasta is amazing and so are the pizzas."
d4203545,July 2022,50,Lovely Italian,Lovely Italian with a great selection of handmade dishes. We had gluten free needs and the gluten free pasta was good (no GF pizza though). Very friendly staff who were working so hard
d4203545,July 2022,50,good food good people,"Very good pizza, very tasty e il Personale súper amable! Sicuramnte torneremo! Дуже смачна піца нам сподобалось"
d4203545,June 2022,50,A little piece of Italy in Amsterdam,Found through Trip advisor and we were not disappointed. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was great and the food brilliant. The only down side for us was that there were not open Monday or Tuesday otherwise we would have gone back.
d4203545,June 2022,50,Great find!,"Manages to get a cancellation while in Amsterdam with family. Great pizza, super carpaccio and lovely pasta. House wine at EUR4 a glass was delicious - highly recommended if you can get a table!"
d4203545,May 2022,50,realy cozy,"The restaurant „Eatmosfera“ proclaims to be real authentic italian kitchen, and it sure is. The menu is well balanced & offers a great selection of white & red wines but you can find different meals of the day as well.    The pizza had a light & fluffy dough & came with fresh & tasteful ingredients, pretty much like the ones you get in naples, italy. The seafood pasta was super fresh as well & the tiramisu was the best we‘ve ever had.    The personell was kind hearted & professional so no order, even the obligatory extra parmesan cheese, would be lost – all in all 5 / 5 stars and a sureshot for a cozy dinner night & a well executed italian kitchen experience."
d4203545,May 2022,10,We had to get shwarma after,"We arrived right on time for our reservation but, we had to wait for them to make space. Pasta was cooked well, good portion but all 3 pasta was oversalted. Lamb rack was awful, overcooked and it smelled of fish. Also the menü on t.a. is not being uploaded. Restaurant itself is crammed, not very athmospheric. Wouldnt suggest anyone, not great experience."
d4203545,April 2022,50,Ladies night,"A movie and a dinner was the plan and we felt like Italian. The ambient was cozy and intimate, the service pleasant and helpful. Their pizza chef was not working so we could only order the pasta but let me tell you, that proved to be the best thing ever. Usually pasta always disappoints me at a restaurant but these dishes were so good that we finished every last bit off the plate. Their pasta is homemade and delicious. Definitely going back!"
d4203545,March 2022,40,Good food - very nice service,"We went to the restaurant with some friends, that is very well located. We all took pizzas which were very nice, even though some of them were supposed to have truffle pesto and were served without. But the waiter was super nice and offered us one of the pizzas and tried to find solutions. I will come back!"
d4203545,February 2022,50,Evening meal in Amsterdam,"Eatmosfera, Excellent service, Excellent meals, the Ravioli was superb.reasonbly priced,a must visit"
d4203545,November 2021,10,Terrible place,"The place smelled awful, the service was horrible and the food was nothing special. I wouldn't recommend go there, we had a really bad experience!"
d4203545,September 2020,20,Oddest meal ever,Food was actually really nice but the service was atrocious. Also tried to charge me €20 more than was billed.
d4203545,May 2020,30,Pizza was really just ok.,Pizza was really just ok. Food was good but a far cry from the time I visited some time back. Could be do to delivery
d4203545,March 2020,30,Not longer the same,"The food is reasonably good for foreigners and tourists, but not at all for Italian and surely the cost/quality ration isn’t justifying the prices they are asking for. My glass of wine despite being the most expensive on the card (by glass) was extremely scarce and quality was not fair for 6,5€/glass, furthermore I was asked by the waiter how I thought of my dish and said truly that it didn’t surprise me, because many of the ingredients were not fresh so that I missed the taste and and the fish was surely coming from the freezer. He answered me saying that tonight they sold already 10 and that nobody complained, so I should consider that, perhaps since the management and kitchen changed, then also the style, quality and education did, only prices remained the same. I won’t visit the place anymore.."
d1503783,July 2022,40,Great place for lunch,"We loved this place! I had the mozzarella pesto baguette which was lovely, which was very large in size and came with a health portion of salad. Right by a canal as well, this was lovely!"
d1503783,June 2022,40,Nice Cafe,We had a nice breakfast here. Coffee was excellent! Breakfast sandwiches were very tasty. My favorite part was sitting outside while we ate. There is a great view of the canal and also excellent people watching with all the bikers heading to work.
d1503783,May 2022,50,"Fresh, flavourful, excellent price","Very fresh, full of flavour and friendly staff. Excellent price for the quality you receive. Was very impressed and we will 100% come back"
d1503783,October 2021,50,Late Breakfast,"A small but efficient place… the omelette was huge, and served on fresh roll with a nice fresh side salad; the goat cheese, walnut and honey dish was hot out of the oven and very good. Just a warning l, it’s cash only but there’s an ATM just up the block."
d1503783,September 2020,50,My favorite cafe,I have been to Amsterdam 4 times and this is my favorite lunch place. The grilled chicken sandwich is enough for two. They used to have homemade apple pie- delicious. The best casual lunch spot!
d1503783,September 2020,50,"Good Service, Good Prices.","Good Service, Good Prices. Better come Early. And you have to pay Cash. Can absolutely reccomend it. its a beatiful Place"
d1503783,June 2020,50,Grs V.,it's so simple and so delicious. very good price for the food offered by the friendly staff. also nice place. thank you !
d1503783,February 2020,50,Got lucky,"Just stumbled across this small cafe and thought would check out the food for a quick snack. Not much space but can eat in if a chair available or takeaway. I had a melted Brie sandwich and it was superb and served with a large salad side dish. Great food, great value, very filling and delicious. Good job."
d1503783,February 2020,50,Worth a visit!,"Every time I visit Amsterdam we visit broodjie berts at least twice and it’s always amazing food. Although it’s small inside, it’s worth the wait! The goats cheese and honey hazelnut dish is amazing!!"
d1503783,January 2020,50,Lovely small cafe with generous,Lovely small cafe with generous portions! Had the omelette which was delicious!! Cash only. Very relaxing to sit in warm cafe and watch the bikes roll by.
d1503783,September 2019,50,One of the best places to eat in,"Place with one of the most delicious food in Amsterdam. Portions are really big and delicious and the prises are not high. The location is very good - not far from centre with the view on the canal.  The only minus is that the restaurant is not very big, but it's not the big problem :)"
d1503783,October 2019,30,Food vs ATM,"The food was a good price for the value, however when it came time to pay they wanted only cash and since i didn't have any, they pointed to a nearby ATM in another shop, which by the way they own the ATM. Which means no where was it displayed on the ATM screen that they hit you with an extra 12% markup, so on my $200 euro withdrawal i paid $252 USD, doesn't sound too appetizing. I only noticed after i printed my ATM receipt and reviewed it after i had left the establishment.    I have a claim going on now with my bank, and i will let the Double Tree Hilton concierge know on how to advise their clients."
d1503783,October 2019,30,Food was good but final cost was questionable,"Upon ordering we were told they only take cash, they pointed to an ATM machine a couple of stores next door, which by the way they own the ATM machine.    The ATM machine did not show the conversion (euro to dollar) rate, once the transaction finished it showed a 12% markup on the conversion. I withdrew $200 euro and got charged $252 to my bank.    Seems to me they make more money referring people to the ATM vs what they make selling their food."
d1503783,October 2019,50,love this place,"Really good and affordable sandwiches!! Great choice of variety, very fast service. My favorite place for lunch!"
d1503783,October 2019,50,Great lunch at great price.,"Tiny place with great egg and bread based choices but I enjoyed a HUGE portion of Bert Burger which was several tasty sausage patties, fries and a generous side salad, enough for two meals for me! I sat at a window and people watched, enjoying my capucino. Interestingly, I saw my meal plate arrive from down the street, which is where the larger kitchen must be! I highly recommend for breakfast and lunch or just a coffee stop."
d12341057,October 2022,50,Must stop. Amazing potato melts in your mouth,"This was amazing. Melt in your mouth. Outstanding quality ingredients. After we ordered they brought it to our table at the Irish pub next. They were so nice, friendly and accommodating. So good. You have to stop. There may be lots of choices but this is a must stop For Something warm delicious and good value. I am going to need to get a second one it’s so good."
d12341057,July 2022,50,Best Baked Potato I've Ever Had,"Me and my partner came here for lunch the one day.    The jacket potatoes we had were huge, very well cooked and were amazing.  I had a basic potato with just some bacon bits on and it was still the best jacket potato I've ever had.  My partner had tuna and cheese, she also loved hers.    We will definitely come back the next time we're in Amsterdam."
d12341057,August 2022,50,Yum,Great and fast food. Potatoes are coming hot and delicious. Plenty of choices. Traditional Dutch potato was very tasty. Yummy😋
d12341057,September 2022,40,Good spot in the centre,"A very pleasant meal, we highly recommend the chicken salad for a fresh meal. The staff was very nice and friendly and the price is very accesible, for being in the center and in general. The average price per person is 15€."
d12341057,August 2022,40,Good food,Few tables. Better to have a reservation. Takes time to order and the order to arrive especially in the peak season. The food is however worth the wait
d12341057,July 2022,50,Baked potato,The best baked potato you’ll have in your life! Chili con carne with cheese was great. Wife ordered traditional beef stew and was also fantastic (very tender).
d12341057,July 2022,40,Worth a visit if you’re hankering for a baked potato,"Very tasty, reasonably priced and relaxed vibe. The half potato was more than enough for me and the whole potato looked gigantic - definitely a full meal. The menu isn’t super expansive but it’s big enough to have a few great options or just plain and build your own toppings."
d12341057,June 2022,50,Amazing place. Best potato.,5/5. Amazing place. Came across it by chance and it is the best potato ever!!!! Would defo recommend. The staff were really nice and friendly and the service was really efficient.
d12341057,March 2022,30,Must have corrected previous apparent staff issues...,"Our experience regarding the staff and service was excellent, unlike many reviews from late 2021. Decent enough food, but considering everything starts with a jacket (baked) potato, there should be an exhaustive menu of toppings from which to choose. There isn't."
d12341057,May 2022,40,"Beef stew on jacket potato was excellent, however service needs improved","The beef stew on the jacket potato was absolutely incredible. Alot of vegetables included too, all were really fresh and tasty. 4* mainly due to the service, it was clear that the waiter was alone and struggling to keep up with the service. Otherwise it would have been 5* for sure."
d12341057,November 2021,10,Unprofessional,"There was a sign that says to wait outside until they seat us, we waited outside for 10 mn in the cold while it was fairly uncrowded, employees would look at us from the window and then choose to ignore us, when I entered to ask about this, the host told to go wait outside in a condensing manner, met with this level of unprofessionalism, we had to leave"
d12341057,November 2021,10,Avoid eating there!!!!!,"Please don't waste your money and time eating here, very rude staff and mediocre food. You are better off spending your money elsewhere!"
d12341057,November 2021,10,Worst Customer Service and Food !,"This review is primarily regarding my disappointing customer service experience at Jacketz yesterday evening around 6pm. I felt compelled to provide you with this feedback as I think it is important that the management of this business intervene as the waiter was highly unprofessional which I suspect stems from the culture created by the staff.    When we arrived to Jacketz, he rudely and abruptly told us to wait outside when we opened the door even though the place was nearly empty with only a few customers, he could have easily requested us in a professional and welcoming tone to wait as he had to review our green pass which we had. He failed to act professionally and subsequently walked away and started to have a laugh with his colleagues and chatting away, whilst we were waiting outside for nearly 10 minutes, even the customers noticed we were waiting outside but despite this he continued to ignore our presence.    Finally, I opened the door and assertively asked him to seat us and gave him instantaneous feedback that we did not appreciate him enjoying a chat whilst we (customers) waited on the arrogant ""waiter"" who instead of apologising, attempted to become confrontational with us . The management of this organisation needs to conduct a performance review on this waiter and ensure that disciplinary action is taken accordingly.    We decided to leave due to his behaviour, it was very clear and obvious that the staff are strategically attempting to deter customers by being dismissive and ignoring them on arrival so they remain idle and have less work to do . You can read other google reviews made which had a similar experience, this business is losing money purely because of the staff who are treating customers with disrespect and unprofessionalism.    Management needs to review the culture and monitor the staff behaviour to keep their customers as the only remaining store in Amsterdam will probably be destined to fail if this continues."
d12341057,November 2021,10,Sub-standard customer service,"Really disappointed with the customer service at Jacketz ... I have been coming here for years (as a tourist.. Jacketz has always been a special place - great food, great ambience). However, I was shocked and saddened to see how the customer service has deteriorated since my last visit. The waiter first asked me to wait outside with an unwelcoming tone (it was a cold night) which I complied with. However, the waiter then proceeded to clean dishes and other non-urgent tasks and laughing with colleagues whilst customers were waiting outside for up to 10 minutes. This gave me a perception of a ""I don't care"" attitude which was so disappointing. I decided to leave as the waiter waiter continued to have a dismissive attitude. I've noticed that many of the Jacketz stores have sadly closed, and am starting to see why... if you treat customers with disrespect they will not return. I never thought I'd give Jacketz a 1 star review, but this will be my final time of visiting a Jacketz restaurant (I believe the last one) in Amsterdam - purely due to the lack of customer service. Management should really offer staff customer service training - a smile or some understanding goes a long way when dealing with your paying customers."
d12341057,September 2021,50,Alternative cuisine,Excellent jacket potatoes. Casual place with reasonable prices. Enjoyed the food and the wheat beer on tap. Was a nice change to other food we were eating on this trip. Do visit.
d8715527,September 2022,10,Appalling customer service,"I don’t normally write reviews but I really had to for this restaurant. We didn’t get to even try the food as we were waiting for a long time just to be served. Two other parties came in a lot later after us and even they got served first despite us getting the waitress attention multiple times. The waitress was so rude and didn’t even want to be there, and maybe she shouldn’t."
d8715527,June 2022,50,A Must Try :-),"Great food!!! The staff is so friendly and quick! We’ve come back 4-5 times and always enjoy the Ultimate Classic sandwich as well as their Yellow Juice. Highly recommend for a nice, healthy lunch! Definitely fills us up every time :)"
d8715527,June 2022,50,yummy breakfast in the heart of Amsterdam,"Looking for an early price-cheap healthy breakfast spot in Centraal, we came across toastable after a long time. It was the right decision, in good weather you can sit outside at a small table for two, or sit inside or have it delivered via various vendors.  Open every day from nine o'clock.  There are different toasted toast varieties that are generously topped from vegan, to chicken over vegetarian. 3 slices of toast on top of each other, either in wheat or dark. Prices per toast to max 10€ and you can be very well full after one toast. Everything tastes very real and full of flavor. I would say that it tastes good to everyone! Be sure to stop by there :-)"
d8715527,May 2022,40,Grilled Cheese Lovers Paradise.,Crowds are a good indication of a good place to eat and Toastables was crowded so we gave it a try. And it was a very good place to eat lunch. We had the best Grilled Cheese & Ham Sandwiches that were really big and really good. Service was very friendly and they still have a great playlist going on.
d8715527,April 2022,40,"Good food, nice atmosphere",Really tasty food. Great stop off for lunch and coffee. Chai coffee was yum. Service was good but not great. Few nice vegetarian and vegan options too Maybe wouldn’t want to be in a rush but would still recommend
d8715527,April 2022,40,Service with a smile!,Friendly service and tasty food! A great morning stop off before exploring Amsterdam. The ham and cheese croissants and Fajita toastie were just what we needed!
d8715527,February 2022,40,Great fast food!,"Delicious, quick and the perfect option for lunch on-the-go. The menu has a good selection of Toasties for everyones taste. It's a cheap, filling lunch. Well worth a visit."
d8715527,November 2021,50,Delicious toasties,"I’ve been to Toastable several times now, and it’s always great. Really tasty toasties with a generous amount of fillings inside. Definitely recommend!"
d8715527,November 2021,50,Good & fast breakfast,"Great juices, staff is friendly and obviously very good toasts. Also good Espresso. I had the classic breakfast toast."
d8715527,October 2021,50,Nice place for breakfast/brunch,"We actually had other breakfast planned the day we wondered to Toastable, because the first place we went to was closed, and the next had really long waiting line and since we were really hungry we decided just to sit down at the next restaurant that had table available.  Bringing us to Toastable.  Cozy, little place that have great variations in their breakfast menu. Ordered myself a croissant with tomatoes, cheese and holy guacamole, freshly squished juice and a latte. Everything was really tasty. My partner had a chicken sandwich with curry dressing. Do recommend both."
d8715527,September 2021,50,Amazing Food & Service,"The food and service is amazing! I highly recommend this place + amazing an music playlist, if you’re in town and looking for a place, this is it."
d8715527,February 2020,50,The best toastie I have ever had!,"Wow.  This place was just the best find on a very wet and horrible dreary day in amsterdam!  The place was busy but we managed to get a seat right at the back!  To be fair, I love a good cheese toastie but didnt really expect what I actually got!  This was honestly the best cheese toastie I have ever had!  My partner also really loved hers!  It is just a cheese lovers heaven!  If I am ever up this way in amsterdam again then I will be sure to visit!  I have tried to recreate it myself at home and failed miserably so will just have to fly over for another!  Thank you!"
d8715527,August 2020,50,Great variety of food ! Toast,Great variety of food ! Toast full of cheese and additional things that you can choose with nice menu. Coffee great too ! Highly recommended for good start of the day in Amsterdam.
d8715527,December 2019,30,Best toastie in dam,"Best toastie I’ve found after 3 trips to amsterdam. Good selection of fillings and drinks, price not bad for Amsterdam. Although, waiting time seems excessive for a toasted sandwich and the staff don’t seem too friendly towards British tourists. Have visited several times during my last 3 visits to Amsterdam and have noticed a difference,  in a lot of places including this one, in the service staff provide to British tourists as opposed to residents of the Netherlands."
d8715527,July 2020,50,Nice,"When it comes to the city standard, affordable, sumptuous & tasty. Toasts r better pick than an omlette."
d3657552,September 2022,40,Great place but very disappointing last visit!,"My girlfriend and I really like the vibe of this place and the cocktails are by far one of the best in Amsterdam. It is truly a shame that on our last visit we waited outside for a while and then were led to the bar to have a drink until a free spot became available. Although sipping at cocktails while standing by the bar and taking in the bustling atmosphere has its charm, this was no short wait.. Much to our surprise, we then realised that the person who had been waiting behind us in the line (and was clearly on friendly terms with all the staff members) had been given the only free table. So disappointing to see that! It ruined our experience so we headed for the exit doors after a round. We will come back as the place is great and these unprofessional blips will not discourage us:)"
d3657552,September 2022,50,Definitely stop for a cocktail,Amazing cocktails and super friendly staff. Atmosphere was perfect! Hip speakeasy cocktail bar with a fab vibe. Eclectic. Cozy.
d3657552,August 2022,50,My liver is glad they are not open 7 days a week,"Great cocktails, great staff from the gentleman. At the door. Loved everything we had there. One of the few places we will keep coming back to when in Amsterdam"
d3657552,August 2022,50,Great cocktails,Great cocktail bar make their own creations which are lovely but also mix whatever your favourite cocktail is and mix it well. I had two from the menu and a mojito my wife had the same with a Bloody Mary extra spicy . We had a bar snack which was nice but I’d caution this is not a Restraunt. It’s not cheap but by city centre prices I didn’t think it expensive either. The decor is classy and the ambience really cool. The staff were ver friendly and good fun. Couldn’t get in on the Friday ( they control entry to keep the ambience) . Went at 5:30 on the Saturday. Adult bar for adults to enjoy a drink! Recommended
d3657552,July 2022,50,This place deserve some of your time !,"Positively surprised at any point.  This place is great ! Looking good, cosy and chill with a old whiskey bar vibe.  All the staff is warmly welcoming you, always ready to discuss and feed you with all the positivity you need.  The cocktails are great and thanks to the attention to details that the staff is having, they are making them evolve to reach your taste during the time you are here (of course you need to take more than one, but it's totally worth it !).  Clearly a place i will now visit everytime im coming around !"
d3657552,July 2022,50,Fabulous cocktails!,Really enjoyed our experience in this lovely cocktail bar. The menu is really thought out and the staff are super helpful. Lovely touch that they give a bottle of water along with each drink. Thank you and will return!
d3657552,July 2022,50,A must visit!,"Visited Tales & Spirit following a recommendation from a friend and it did not disappoint. What a fantastic experience. We arrived as soon as it opened on the Saturday and opted for a window table. The bar gets busy quick, so recommend getting there early. The cocktails are unique and some even have their own theatrics. We recommend ‘Zombie’ for a memorable moment. Also recommend getting some bitter ballen as it’s the best we’ve ever had!    Can’t wait to visit again next time we are in Amsterdam."
d3657552,May 2022,50,Best cocktails in town,"The best cocktails in town. Great staff, food is good and clientele is polite and friendly.  John, the bartender, listens carefully to your requests and serves you like a champion.  Alessandro, the waiter, loves to mele sure you’re comfortable and happy.  Can you ask for more?"
d3657552,April 2022,50,Good Recommendation,Our 30 something year old son suggested we 50 year olds go check out this cool small bar. We were skeptical but pleasantly surprised. We really lucked into a 4 top because it is very busy. They ask for your coats as you walk in because they are very strict about no drugs being brought into their establishment. We were fine with it and felt very comfortable even though we were the old peeps in the bar. Fun place with great atmosphere and the drinks were amazing. Would suggest checking it out. Go early...
d3657552,February 2022,10,Disappointed,"An absolute disappointment. After reading the good reviews we had high expectations. At the door we were asked for our QR codes, which we showed. Then we also had to show our ID. My wife couldn’t show hers and we were refused to get in. Showing bank pass wasn’t enough. The worst thing was that the guy at the door treated us very unfriendly and rude and was not prepared to help. The place was nearly empty, so I don’t understand why they didn’t want our business. According to the door man masks were not required, so they were no very consequent. NEVER AGAIN!"
d3657552,September 2020,50,Our new favorite spot. Outstanding,Our new favorite spot. Outstanding and creative cocktails. Great vibe. Friendly and attentive service (even outside). The mixologist will come talk to you about what he created (he didn’t let us down once!). Make a reservation though (due to covid). Not cheap but worth it. You won’t regret the experience.
d3657552,August 2020,50,My favourite bar in Amsterdam!,"My favourite bar in Amsterdam!    I have been here twice now and both times have had an amazing experience. The service is impeccable, you can see the staff love their job, the cocktails are amazing and very fairly priced!    Make sure you make a reservation though!  I booked this for my boyfriends birthday, we had Jan (sorry if i misspelt your name!) who served our drinks, he was honestly amazing, so friendly and with a great humour. Make sure you try the Zombie!"
d3657552,August 2020,30,Unexpected surprise!,The staff was very friendly and helpful with the choice of cocktails. The menu present quite a lot and intresting cocktails; I personally chose the Eureka which was served literally in a bulb with a small light inside. Brilliant Idea! The place is quite small so I would advise to book in advance if you are a large group.
d3657552,December 2019,40,Not too shabby,"Friendly, efficient, knowledgeable staff (though they made a few mistakes on their history!) serving well presented, flavoursome cocktails. The barman made me his interpretation of a Manhattan, which was slightly in the sweet side, but absolutely delicious! One of the better bars in the city."
d3657552,March 2020,50,A Favourite...,"Great cocktails served by knowledgeable staff who were happy to chat and made my wife and I very welcome. Our favourite of the cocktail bars we visited in Amsterdam, highly recommended."
d1776852,October 2022,50,Amazing thaï restaurant !!,"We had an amazing time in this restaurant ! We passed by it and thought it looked amazing, but they were fully booked, so had to book for the next day : it was worth it ! Such flavors, generous portions, and a good vegetarian selection. The staff was so sweet, explaining the dishes and checking on us frequently. Service was very quick as well, which is great when you’re hungry ! The chef even came over to the tables to chat with all the customers. Wonderful food, wonderful team, you should definitely book a table when in Amsterdam."
d1776852,June 2022,50,Fantastic Food and Service,"We were lucky to get a table without booking, although we were given a time limit and the restaurant was packed.  The food was amazing, possibly the best Thai food we've eaten and we have eaten Thai cuisine all over the world, including in Thailand itself!  The service was excellent - so friendly even though the restaurant was incredibly busy with excellent suggestions and recommendations.  Highly recommend!"
d1776852,August 2022,50,Best Thai restaurant,"Just book it - tasty Thai food, great for vegetarian options. Loved the spring rolls and mango sticky rice for dessert! Really friendly staff, highly recommend. Book in advance to get a table inside!"
d1776852,August 2022,30,Dictated tipping,"Food was great, could've been 5 stars easily because we really had a great evening.    BUT our (up-untill-the-bill-came) charming waitress decided to coerce us into tipping more. We added like 4 euros and she replied that usually guests tip 10%. Welp we were stupid enough to add a few euros.    We decided to substract that tip from our rating on here, so there you go."
d1776852,August 2022,50,"Super friendly, great food","Not a single negative thing to say about this restaurant.  The staff were all genuinely enthusiastic about making our experience as enjoyable as possible, guiding our choices, explaining the meals and checking that everything was going well. Their recommendations were spot on and delicious.  A great evening."
d1776852,August 2022,50,Great thai,"Top recommendation from us even though they forgot our order so we had to wait a while. The food was perfect, the waiters were really kind, and a nice atmosphere."
d1776852,July 2022,50,Amazing Thai Food!,"Really need to leave this review for this restaurant because the food, the service, the attention was just amazing!  In Amsterdam only 2 nights with my partner and because I absolutely adore Thai food, I absolutely had to eat Thai one night! This restaurant did not disappoint. It’s definitely ‘up there’ with the best I’ve had!  The friendly owner worked his tables well making sure everyone was happy. The staff were attentive & always smiley. It’s a small (approx. 20 tables) cosy restaurant with some tables outside too.  We will def be back when we visit again. THANK YOU!"
d1776852,July 2022,50,Recommended to us - and well worth the visit.,"We had looked in TA for Thai restaurants in Amsterdam and saw Krua Thai but when it was independently recommended by our hotel concierge, we knew it would be good. The service was brilliant - warm, welcoming and attentive. The food was delicious - so tasty and fresh, and served quickly. Wine selections were really well paired to the food - I love a vinho verde! The atmosphere was relaxed and really enjoyable and you could sit outside (although we chose inside as was a bit chilly).  Would highly recommend this restaurant (and the people - so lovely!)."
d1776852,July 2022,50,Amazing food that you simply have to experience !,"We arrived in Amsterdam and by accident ended up eating in Krua Thai Classic, what a wonderful accident it ended up being! We both love Thai food and have visited Thailand many times but never have we experienced such amazing dishes that we were served at Krua Thai Classic. The owner took time to understand what we liked and suggested specific dishes from the menu that we would never have chosen ourselves. The starter we shared was Meang Kham ; an explosion of flavours in your mouth! Ive never tasted anything like it! You must try it if you go.  Our main courses didnt disappoint either, such wonderful food  I would definitely recommend that you visit . Such an great experience  Fabulous friendly service , amazing food and great prices  A must!  Kate and Ian"
d1776852,July 2022,50,Very nice restaurant with excellent food!,"very nice, small thai restaurant with very friendly staff. the food was delicious and very large portions. the phad thai was amazing."
d1776852,June 2022,50,Service that is genuine,"Can't say enough good things about this place. We came upon this restaurant by accident after a long cold wet evening. Even though it was about 10 pm and we were hoping that they would be kind and do a takeaway order they invited us to sit and dine in the restaurant. Everything we had was amazing - clean flavors, fresh ingredients - sooo good.  The staff was eager to please and so pleasant and warm."
d1776852,June 2022,50,Fantastic Thai restaurant that you must visit in Amsterdam,"We were recommended this restaurant by an Irish waitress at a bar and boy did it not disappoint!! The welcome was really friendly , the waiter went through the menu explaining the specials and helping us choose and the food was out of this world . Clean plates and 4 very happy travellers ."
d1776852,May 2022,50,Excellent,We had a group of 5. Service was excellent and the menu was very good. We have a few of the chefs choices made for us and the food was great. Overall night was great and I would return again
d1776852,April 2022,50,"Fresh flavors, friendly service",Friendly service. Super fresh ingredients. All around lovely experience in this family owned/family run restaurant.
d1776852,April 2022,50,Best Thai restaurant in Amsterdam,"The food was wonderful and delicious, the chef and waiters were very talkative and friendly, and even suggested better foods to us. Service was superb as well. Will come back the next time!"
d1229275,September 2022,50,"First class food, great service","Great food, Italian excellence all the way through. Service friendly and helpful and wine suggestion really made it a pleasant evening."
d1229275,July 2022,50,Ideal Italian.,We had a lovely birthday dinner for my husband here. The food was delicious and the staff were very attentive. Our meals were brought to us in good timing and the meals were explained perfectly as delivered . I’d happily return here…if I were to...More
d1229275,June 2022,50,Delighful Evening,"We discovered this treasure based on a reccommendation from our hotel. We had the 5 course dinner and were not disappointed. All courses were well prepared and very tasty. The waitstaff was attenive and very helpful, suggesting a great wine for our dinner. A great restaurant in the 9 Streets area."
d1229275,June 2022,40,Charming place. Meal does not worth it.Bread fantastic.,"We love the atmosphere of the place. The service is absolutely excellent and helpful. But the evening menu is highly concise. There is no variety. The risotto is delicious. The eggplants are not so much and are highly salted. The beef is mediocre. The bread is fantastic. The focaccia is very salty as well. In my opinion, the place is charming, but given the cost of the dishes, the food could be better."
d1229275,May 2022,50,Incredible Degustazione meal!,"Just around the corner from The Hotel Pulitzer is this quaint cafe! We chose the Chef's 5 course dinner! Great cocktails- I had an Aperol spritzer! From the fresh bread baked on premises that we could not stop eating to the Beetroot salad, quail, ravioli with lamb and I chose the fish and my husband had the beef entrecote topped off by a pineapple tart with bourbon ice cream! Every dish was expertly and creatively prepared! Great staff all around ! A true gem!"
d1229275,May 2022,50,Excellent,Exceptional. Always great. The pasta is something else and the ambiance and service are great. Very reasonable value for the money
d1229275,May 2022,50,World class restaurant,"This small and elegant restaurant was an amazing find. Every bit as good as all the reviews state, the food here is amazing. This would be a five-star restaurant in Manhattan. Service is impeccable, food wonderful. Highly, highly recommend."
d1229275,March 2022,50,Really Lovely Lunch!,"We booked lunch for four last weekend. The welcome was friendly and we were quickly seated on a big round table.  The lunch menu gave us lots of choice and we ordered a bottle of rosé.  The wine was lovely.  The main courses we had consisted of salads, sandwiches and a ravioli dish. All were excellent, as was the coffee.  All in all a great lunch with excellent service from a waiter who gave a great description of the wine and food.  Definitely worth a visit and we shall be back for dinner in the future."
d1229275,March 2022,50,Wonderful tasting menu and stellar service,"We happened upon Bussia on a 20 hour layover, while walking the canals. The space was beautiful and we peeked in to see if it was possible to seat us for dinner. Paulo hesitated and then said, “Let me see if I can work some magic.”    Paulo produced magic and the team at Bussia presented a 5 course tasting menu and wine pairing that will not be forgotten. They had no idea this was our 25th wedding anniversary dinner and they couldn’t have been more generous, hospitable and gracious. Paulo was generous with his descriptions and answers about our wine pairings and I would have thought him to be the Somm.    We’ve had the pleasure of dining in some amazing locales and experiencing some of the best menus and Bussia has made our top 10 list, alongside places like Moments in Barcelona, Junebaby in Seattle and The Willows on Lummi Island.    We will look forward to the day we can join them again. Until then, continue to make magic happen!"
d1229275,March 2022,50,Buono e gustoso,"The menu is not very extensive, but there is still enough choice for everyone. Opted for the Menu Degustazione: a selection of the a la carte dishes. A short summary: beautifully laid out plates, delicious high-quality dishes and extremely friendly service. Don't hesitate, go there if you enjoy good cuisine."
d1229275,February 2022,50,Real Italian breakfast!,"We tried pastries, coffee and cappuccino - everything was great! A real Italian delight in the heart of Amsterdam. Incredibly kind and welcoming waiters and also lovely place, we'll be back for sure."
d1229275,December 2021,30,Cafeteria style,Granted was warned the menu was limited on a Sunday lunch but one could be forgiven for thinking even on a normal day with the full menu on song that the atmosphere would be decidedly cafeteria style without any of the elegance that could be ascribed to an Italian eatery recommended as amongst the best in town !
d1229275,December 2021,30,So so,It’s definitely not a modernist cuisine. Pasta and pizza as in every regular Italian restaurant around your corner. It was good but not as expected
d1229275,October 2021,50,Excellent,"We were lucky to find this gem, and extremely lucky to have found it on Sunday... they do pizzas on Sunday. Loved their sourdough pizzas... unbelievably good. Even their pasta was tasty. And the desserts were really really special! A must try!!!"
d1229275,November 2021,50,Excellent,"Back after the pandemic— high quality food, exceptional service and overall very reasonable value for the money. Excellent"
d4328782,September 2022,50,Best Indian restaurant- hands down! Great ambiance and customer service,"Best indian restaurant I’ve ever been to!!! We are from the US and nothing beats the ambiance and the taste/quality of the food. The manager was so nice to accomdate us for a last minute booking and we couldnt have been more appreciative! Presentation, location, customer service were all a 5-star rating."
d4328782,August 2022,50,Just Amazing,"Went here for dinner with my partner & from start to finish you were made to feel special. Food was amazing, staff, deco fabulous. We will definitely be coming back here."
d4328782,September 2022,50,Best Butter Chicken Ever,We were recently in the central part of Amsterdam and near our hotel was the Ashoka restaurant that offers fine Indian and Nepalese cuisine. I can't tell you enough how we enjoyed their Indian butter chicken and the whole dining experience was wonderful. You can tell that the owner pays attention to the cuisine and the entire dining experience. The owner's Daughter took care of us and her aura was nothing but kindness and hopeful that we would have a great experience. I highly recommend this great restaurant.
d4328782,September 2022,50,Understated but top quality,"From the outside this looks a pleasant enough restaurant, but inside the quality of the food offer is top drawer. Popular with locals and visitors alike, this is a buzzy but unpretentious place with te emphasis on the food."
d4328782,September 2022,50,Loved the food!,Chicken & Veg Momos (Dumplings) the Non Veg Platter all were v tasty! Great ambience. Located within walking distance of Dam Square and Centraal.
d4328782,September 2022,50,Amazing food,This is the best Indian food I've had! The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside but is absolutely stunning and bigger then what you'd think. The service was brilliant and the food exceptional. A bit on the pricey side but well worth the money!!!
d4328782,September 2022,50,Amazing Indian food in Amsterdam,"They have a wide variety of Indian and Nepalese food with different chili degrees, all what we took upon the recommendation of the waiters were delicious. The service was distinguished, all the staff were very friendly and helpful"
d4328782,September 2022,50,Very cordial and friendly staff creating an excellent family dinner outing experience,Excellent authentic Indian and Nepalese food. Very cordial and friendly staff creating an excellent family dinner outing experience! Must try the Kokhura Ko Masu - the authentic Nepalese chicken and the Keema Naan - just wonderful!
d4328782,September 2022,50,"Found by coincidence, but great experience","Found by coincidence strolling through Amsterdam, it was a really pleasant experience. Very nice and delicious food, freshly made an very tasty. Very friendly staff and brilliant atmosphere. We’ll come back again."
d4328782,September 2022,50,Excellent!,"Delicious food, excellent service and very friendly staff! If you want a genuine and original taste of Indian/Nepal food, you should definitely come here!"
d4328782,September 2022,50,Amazing Ashoka,"Wow! What a beautifully crafted menu, with flavours to suit all. Had the Mixed Platter, and the combination of flavours worked so well as an Appetiser. Followed this with a taster of Lentil Dal, Vegetable Curry, and Chicken dish. Absolutely stunning! Had to taste the wifes Korma too. I can honestly say the best meal I have eaten of this cuisine!"
d4328782,August 2022,40,First time trying indian food in a restaurant,"I went here with my friend during our trip to Amsterdam, the place is beautiful, elegant and calm. We ordered chicken momo and paneer to start and then i had butter chicken with white rice plus a tandoori roti while my friend ordered lamb biryani. Everything was delicious, also must try the mango lassi very refreshing.  Service very attentive and professional.  Thank you!"
d4328782,August 2022,40,"Diner 2 times in 2,5 weeks",I went back for a second dinner in 2.5 weeks means that the first dinner impressed me and my family. The ambiance of this restaurant is great. The tables are not suitable for family size groups maybe some bigger tables can be added just dropping an idea.  Although in my opinion a very good place to dine I had a little less experience which I want to share. Yesterday I was there again and ordered the royal thali - it was a bit disappointment as I have different experience with thali's and if you order a royal Thali you expect something very special. My Thali meal was even forgotten and when brought also not complete.  Next to that we wanted to order Bhindi without masala which was not possible - from my view if the meal is prepared fresh a request to not add masala should not be an issue for a establishment like Ashoka. The waiter didn't even bother to ask the chef if it was possible.
d4328782,August 2022,50,Best indian/nepalese since a long time!,"Very nice atmosphere, competent and kind staff and very good choice of tasty, healthy and fresh food. I advise to book in advance, they are always very busy."
d4328782,July 2022,40,Friendly atmosphere and beautiful food,"We had not made a reservation but it wasn't an issue and we were accommodated with a 30mins wait (plenty of bars by the canals around to have a pre dinner drink)    Plenty of variety on the menu including vegetarians but not too many that the choice was too hard to make. Dishes generally have an option of mild, medium or hot. I had a butter chicken which I did ask for mild but did have a bit more heat than use to with this kind of dish but was equally enjoyable. This is the only reason why it lost a star which would only be half but I cannot do that.    Staff were helpful and attentive but not pushy. We were the last table left in restaurant but didn't feel like we had to leave."
d3323106,September 2022,50,Great restaurant,Great restaurant and especially great service from Julia! The sashimi and pernod crustaceans were great. The food was fresh and really tastefully. Julia was fast and friendly!

d3323106,September 2022,50,Sublime,"As we could not book, the restaurant leaves a percentage for walk ins, we wandered along from our hotel. So glad we did. We did not have to wait too long. Excellent friendly service. Great value."
d3323106,October 2022,50,Delicious diner with family and great service!,"1st of October me and my Family had an amazing diner at The Seafood Bar. The food was delicious and the service was very good. Our compliments to your employee Julia, she made our visit remarkable and makes us want to visit the restaurant again for a good and tasty experience."
d3323106,October 2022,40,Good place,Everything was very good from food to service Highly recommended Good value. Beware very nice shrimp dish comes with heads and shell. Lots of work.
d3323106,October 2022,50,Delicious Good and Impeccable Service,The food I had at The Seafood Bar was the best I've had this year. And I've had the esteem privilege of eating at two which were Michelin rated.    Aimee provided the most top notch customer service. After lunch I was no longer in her section and she still continued to be my host. The other servers also stopped at moments to check on me. I didn't feel rushed at all even though they had a wait.    Food:  Oysters - on happy hour  Mussels - French style  Mixed grill    This place is the real deal! Just go you will not be disappointed at all.
d3323106,October 2022,50,Delicious!,"Fantastic food, delicious mussels, amazing service by Julia. Highly recommend, will definitely visit again in the near future!"
d3323106,September 2022,50,Staff review and food,We had the seafood mix and it was fresh and delicious! Milano's service was fantastic. Very attentive and proactive.

d3323106,September 2022,50,"Highly recommended, fresh seafood","Was very impressed with the service provided by Milano. The food here was also great, seafood is really fresh. Highly recommended!"
d3323106,September 2022,50,Best Restaurant im AMS!!!! Love this place!,"Awesome seafood restaurant probably our favorite restaurant in Amsterdam, so much so that we came back twice!!! We got the mixed grill for 2 was and it was an amazing deal for 77 euros. Also the wait staff was very friendly and amazing including the restaurant manager as well as Flona and Sev. Everybody remembered us and treated us great :) will definitely come back if we are ever in Amsterdam"
d3323106,September 2022,50,Great!,"You need to go here! Excellent wine, food and service. Very busy even on a Monday night. We stopped by on an afternoon walk as our hotel recommended this restaurant and made a reservation for tonight. The food was great. Prices we were quite reasonable, especially for the wine. Our first night in Amsterdam will be hard to beat."
d3323106,September 2022,50,Seafood Bar,"What a nice place, thanks to Aimee. Such fresh and delicious fishfood, the best wine and service. Thank you Aimee, for your humor and encredible good service. It was our anniversary, and it was great and unforgettable."
d6649841,September 2022,40,"Great mussels, wonderful gin cocktail if you can bear the blasting sound","After a visit to an art fair in the westergas park, on a horribly rainy night, I did not want to go far and tried this restaurant. The truffel mussels were fantastic, the gin cocktail a perfect accompaniment, and we get to take home our free tube of gin-mayo, a vegan mayonnaise (Don't ask what's in it!).  Had the weather been better I would have sat outside, but the blasting music was definitely reduced the appreciation of the meal.  I do not know why, restaurants believe that blasting decibels is necessary in a restaurant. As they say, there should be a law! Why don't they blast their sound system in one area, and at least leave another area without speakers, a little like the old smoking-no smoking sections. To be considered."
d6649841,April 2022,50,An excellent combination,"Not so far from the city center, we found that gem. The place was interesting, the service amazing and super friendly and the mussel pots delicious. Oh, I forgot the great Gin cocktails. It was definitely a dinner to remember!"
d6649841,April 2022,50,Great cafe in the park,Great seafood cafe inside the park. Everything is fresh there (what is most important for mussels and oysters for sure). Great gin drinks. And if it is especially sunny- you do not want to leave.
d6649841,October 2021,50,"Good Food, Good Location and Oh that Gin","Local restaurant with great mussels and frites, Try the gin mayo Don't miss the infused gin drinks--I had two"
d6649841,October 2021,50,Fun spot,Our drinks were delicious and the service great- unique drinks and our server was helpful in guiding us to good choices Westerpark is a great setting
d6649841,July 2020,40,2 things simply done very well!,"I have been to Mossel & Gin twice now and both times have been really nice. They only do two things, Mussels + Gin & Tonics, however they do them both REALLY well.    The new ordering / QR code system works nicely and everything arrives in quick time. The Gins are all wonderful, refreshing and different and there is enough variety of mussel flavors for everyone.    The Roquefort & truffle mussels are delicious however they can be very rich so it can be a struggle to eat them all as the portions are very generous here.    They play really good music so sitting outside on the terrace is recommended in the summer!"
d6649841,June 2020,10,there are no words to describe,"there are no words to describe this place a restaurant ... super expensive, we took two fried fish and some potatoes were fried three times full of oil and dried .... finally the mussels without flavor full of cooking cream and ginger .... the wine was water with sulphites but the wine did not exist all this 90 euro given away and everything remained on the table ....."
d6649841,February 2020,50,Innovating,"A really alternative place where to eat good food,well presented and with an amazing selection of gins...the gin mayo was superlative!! The two guys who own the place are simply awesome!looking forward to go back in Amsterdam"
d6649841,January 2020,50,Lovely lunch,Woww this is a awesome place! Love the spot middle of the Westerpark. The owner josh is so passionate about serving the ocean life. The mussels are the best I ever have tasted. We highly requirement mossel and gin!
d6649841,January 2020,50,Best nice funky mossels in town,Super cool nice hip please in the middle of the Westerpark. Lots of infused gin and different kinds of mossels. My fav is the Zeeuwse spek (bacon)!!😍
d6649841,January 2020,50,"Fantastic food, great service!","We made a booking online, then were greeted with unfortunate news - there was no space for us! For context, this was a friendly greeting from the owner, who offered us a free drink on the house and to sit outside under the heaters while we waited. This to me, is what fantastic service means. You can't always control things like how long previous customers remain in their seats, but you can compensate to make sure that problems are solved, which is exactly what happened.    Once we were seated, the place continued to impress. The food was spectacular, and their gins were equally delicious. The atmosphere was warm and simply stylish. This was one of my Amsterdam highlights, and deserves it's stellar reputation. I don't even like Mussels, and I'm now a convert! ^_^"
d6649841,November 2019,20,Plan in advance,"We were visiting Amsterdam and picked this out after some research into restaurants that would be ""different"" - and it is.  It serves seafood and specialises in gin, though some wine is available if you ask for it. However, the problem we found is that it is located in a park and when, at 8.00 p.m. we arrived at the entrance to the park in a taxi, we found the barrier closed. We had to walk through the park to the restaurant - which was not very comfortable - it was cold, damp, and the paths are poorly lit.  The restaurant had made a mess of my booking, but ""fortunately"" there was a spare table beside the bar. It was not very conducive to a relaxed meal, particularly as the tables are closely packed together and a diner at an adjoining table was accompanied by his dog - not a guide dog for someone who is visually impaired, but a large pet dog. This evidently is encouraged by the restaurant as the staff gave the dog a water bowl.  We had a quick snack and we fled.  If anyone wants to try this restaurant, I suggest that you either go in Summer when it's bright in the evenings, or go for lunch in the winter."
d6649841,November 2019,40,Cozy Cozy Cozy Gin Cozy,Nice agreeable perfect service and friendly environment great Gin choice and food great great I will return for sure!!
d6649841,October 2019,50,‘Musselman’ found his best shop!,"I was once called ‘mussel’ man by friend. I travelled the world and the Seven seas to taste yummy mussels . Been tasted mussels from Belgium, London, Tasmania, US, Asia....    This shops bought me absolute excitement!    They have apart from classic flavor, 5 other flavors  The black truffle is a must try !  Thai and mustard are great too !    I went in 3 days for my trip and tasted all 6 flavors    The owner Wouter is super friendly !    I got recommendation from a local Dutch colleague to this restaurant when I asked where to have mussels in Amsterdam  Bcoz I know even the ones served in Belgium are grown here    They are very tender and juicy  Unlike other species    Also worth mentioning is the potato chips to go with the mussels  They are extra crispy and tasty  The owner told me they have the potatoes sent in fresh daily and they prepared in a special way  No wonder !!    Overall  This is the best mussel shop I tasted so far in my life  I asked Wouter to inform me if they have new recipe  And I shall fly to visit them again !    You can take bus from the upper platform of central station to here  Takes only 10 mins or so  Easy !"
d6649841,October 2019,50,Gin. Moules frites!,"Gin. Moules frites in Different ”shapes”, small courses to share. Nice staff! Always a favorite to visit!"
d3626201,July 2022,40,Great for a fast lunch,"We stopped for a quick, light lunch. One order of the Fried Cod was fine for the two of us. Friendly service. Very reasonably priced."
d3626201,May 2022,50,Best herrings in Amsterdam,"We set out for five days determined to eat a herring every day, in a different part of the city. This is the only one we returned to - and we took vacuum packed fillets home, too. We had early season herrings, fat and oily, delicious on their own or with onions and on a bun. We also tasted the small shrimps, smoked and just right. Excellent, and if you find a seat - also an excellent place to people watch. Take your time and enjoy."
d3626201,November 2021,50,This stall was visited by the late Anthony Bourdain in the episode 'The Layover Amsterdam',"YES, in case you're wondering: this is the stall Anthony Bourdain visited in the episode 'The Layover Amsterdam'. The specialty of the house is the baby herring (in Dutch 'maatje') and it is served straight up with onions and pickles, with or without a sandwich (I recommend eating it like the Dutch: not cut and no sandwich).  If you like sushi or rollmops, you'll also be able to appreciate this Dutch treat.  The current price for a straight-up baby herring with no sandwich is € 3,50, so it's a bit pricey but you do get quality for it in return."
d3626201,June 2020,50,Delicious,"Whenever I pass by Frans Haringhandel I always buy and enjoy a hearing. I’ve no idea how many I’ve eaten but it has to be several hundred. Consistent high quality.. The shrimp,other herring and cooked fish available is also of Hin qualty."
d3626201,July 2020,50,Great herring sandwiches,Very nice sandwiches ! Just bread with herring and you can add onions and pickles if you want. The herring tasted wonderful but they also have other choices of fishes. Simple but perfect !
d3626201,March 2020,50,The place for seafood on the go,"This seafood stall is a must for anyone curious about Dutch snack food.It is in a popular spot and in the current situation is a Godsend.The staff run a clean efficient service, and the food is fresh and delicious to eat.The Kibbelings with mayonnaise melted in the mouth."
d3626201,January 2020,50,Must try,"It was my first time to try raw herring. i am used to smoked herring from where i come from and never thought of it as a raw. i thought i will have hard time to finish my bites but the reality was unexpected, i made one more :)    Location is convenient in the middle of the city and next to tram station. can't wait for another raw herring experience one day."
d3626201,February 2020,50,"Delicious, well-prices, well-positioned.","Delicious, well-prices, well-positioned. Efficient and just overall yum!  We stopped off for a little snack, we really enjoyed the food and the owners were friendly."
d3626201,November 2019,50,Fabulous!,"We finally stopped for herring at the stall after walking past it several times during our week in Amsterdam. We had herring in several restaurants, but needed to have the true experience of eating herring on the street. We love fish and we loved the herring. I wish we had these stalls in the US!!"
d3626201,November 2019,50,Fantastic haring....,"As soon as I arrive in the city of Amsterdam I race to buy the traditional haring (herring) served in a bread roll with finely chopped raw onion & gherkin!! It’s absolutely fantastic, the haring melts in your mouth. Current price is €4.50  Don’t leave Amsterdam without eating a haring from this stall, it’s essential."
d3626201,September 2019,50,Must visit institution,"When in Amsterdam, you have to eat a Herring at one of these stalls. Frens is very good and the fish was very fresh, think of it as sort of Dutch Sushi."
d3626201,September 2019,50,Had to try it!,Yep. Had to try it. I did and wanted more. I was so sad that I wasn’t staying longer as I wouldn’t mind eating here daily.
d3626201,December 2018,50,A must-eat when in Amsterdam,"On our recent visit to Amsterdam, everyone had told us that we had to stop by Frens Haringhandel to have the freshest herring (haring) in town. It didn't disappoint! There was a line, but it moved quickly, and their fish was delicious. Great for a mid-morning snack, or on your way to visit any of the local attractions.  Even my 12 year-old daughter loved the herring here!"
d3626201,September 2019,40,Good but bones are not removed,"I reccomend the Kibbeling; deep fried fish, cooked to order. The herring is nice but bones being left in is a shame. The Kibbeling fish in the was fresh and flakey."
d3626201,May 2019,40,A casual pleasure on a canal--Haring PLUS,"My husband and I came across this by accident after leaving a large Rembrandt exhibition at the Rijksmuseum. He needed to recover from the nearly 400 artworks, so we went for a long walk.  I knew about the stand before, because I was scoping out places for him to eat herring, which he adores.  I would have given it perhaps a 5, but there is no seating. There are some benches nearby. I had the lobster fritters, which were ok. I should have ordered the fried cod, which another reviewer mentions. There are numerous options of cured and cooked fish and seafood. We stood most of the time.  Husband loved the herring, better than another restaurant's that we went to the night before, which were pretty good. So we went again at the end of our trip (we were in Belgium and France and flew out of Amsterdam to return to the States). He just had the pickles and onion and not the sandwich. I loved the taste, but in limited quantities. On our second trip, the fresh herring (maatje) was available, since it was mid June."
d7285568,September 2022,50,Canal views with quick service,"We stopped here for an early lunch on our way to Amsterdam Centraal. My wife and I both ordered the chicken/bacon toastie, a toasted sandwich with melted cheese. It came out promptly and tasted yummy. A great short stop along our travels. The setting is along a quieter canal with indoor/outdoor dining option. Staff was friendly and cheerful."
d7285568,September 2022,10,"Delicious food, terrible service!","This could have been an easy 5 stars if it were only for the food and views but service was rather poor at this establishment. Zero acknowledgment from anyone and everyone, especially the ""supervisor"" who made us wait for 20 mins while there were plenty of empty tables by the canal and folks who walked in after us seated themselves without any interaction with the host. Guess that's how it worked here but I didn't understand why we were specifically asked to wait. Food was quite delicious when our orders were finally taken and served and eating our meal by the canal was phenomenal. It wasn't a surprise that the check came right as we finished eating. To me, preferential treatment in the restaurant business is completely unacceptable. We received amazing service all around everywhere else on our trip."
d7285568,September 2022,50,Great food and amazing services,"Superb food, friendly service, great location and very affordable prices. What more does one want?! Located on a beautiful canal at the edge of the red light district this little restaurant with both outside and indoor seating is a little gem. The owner, Nathan, used family recipes to creat simple yet very tasteful and beautifully presented dishes. Highly recommended"
d7285568,August 2022,50,Fantastic restaurant. Highly recommend!!,"This restaurant is fantastic. The setting on the canal is gorgeous, on a less touristy street. The atmosphere was just delightful and the food delicious. Our waiter was kind and funny. Highly recommend."
d7285568,August 2022,50,"Yummy, lovely staff",Yummy! Lovely staff. Went on a busy Saturday (pride weekend). Interior was closed due to staff shortage but friendly staff took our order and delivered food all in good time. Quality of food was not compromised. We had a very nice frittata and open chicken sandwich which was a generous portion of real chicken breast The ice T was delicious. Definitely recommend
d7285568,August 2022,50,Greta brunch,Amazing service and tasty food! The owners are so nice and friendly. They couldn’t have been nicer. The food and menu were perfect.

d7285568,July 2022,50,Very good,Very good food which I didn't expect at this place in Amsterdam. Amsterdam is after all very average
d7285568,July 2022,50,Lovely Sunday brunch at the Canal,"Lovely Sunday brunch at a super nice place with terrasse next to the canal.  Enjoying the boats passing by , eating healthy and colourful home made food  Great atmosphere with warm welcoming and friendly waitresses  We could not leave this beautiful spot!!!  Experience it by yourself :-)"
d7285568,May 2022,40,Cute place,Cozy and cute place to have a meal. The staff is welcoming and friendly. Portions are big. Although the one star is missing because I had sand-like something (I believe it was some spice) in my frittata.
d7285568,May 2022,50,Simply great food,"Great and delicious food with fair prices. Cosy atmosphere both inside and outside. We got the open sandwiches with salmon and avocado for lunch, which were amazing . Service was efficient en excellent."

d7285568,February 2022,50,"Super service, great food, cute setting.",We stumbled upon this place by accident. But what a cute little find. Super friendly service and great food. Would 100% recommend.
d7285568,December 2021,50,Next Level Flavour,"I had a vegan hot chocolate with espresso and the vegan quesadilla. I did not expect how massive and flavourful this would be. Lots of garlic, which I love. Their service was friendly and price was pretty good for two people. As I tour around Europe this has been my favourite meal so far ..."

You can see that the ingredients utilised are of high quality. The green pea soup was the best. The mustard soup also amazing. A simple toast and fried eggs with bacon and cheese that makes you wanna eat on your knees. Totally worth a lot of visits.    Ah! Also their steak and cheese sandwich, so delicious."
d1649973,November 2019,40,Nice food,"The food is really delicious, wedged a mixture of juices and steak sandwiches. Everyone loved their food. I'd have given them 5 stars had the guy behind the counter been a little less surly."

d10461623,September 2022,50,Repeat visit & even better than remembered!,"Repeat visit with same group, as enjoyed such great steaks and meals on last visit, and this time we weren't disappointed again! I had one of the best rib eye steaks, (definitely comparable to some of the best, higher priced steakhouses and restaurants). This is a small jewel, with friendly service, and admittedly may not be the trendiest, most fashionable spot, but if its a great steak you're after also at very good value then you can't go wrong ! (Ribs & burgers also good!)"
d10461623,August 2022,50,Best steakhouse in Amsterdam,Great family run establishment and Best steakhouse in Amsterdam. Bahaa the owner is brilliant and made some great recommendations. Highly recommended
d10461623,August 2022,50,Wonderful lunch,Had a wonderful lunch here with the family. Food excellent and a pleasure to meet Boris the owner. Such a genuine man who made us feel like part of his family. Next time in Amsterdam will be at This restaurant with the main man! Thank you Boris
d10461623,July 2022,50,great food and great people working there!,"One of the best restaurants i’ve eaten in Amsterdam, the owner was the best! I found this restaurant through google maps, and it was a great surprise!  He was super nice to me and my family and the food was great. I fell in love with the place and the food, everything was spectacular and I had a great time!  If I ever come back to Amsterdam i’ll for sure eat here!  hopefully we’ll meet again!"
d10461623,July 2022,50,Boris is a great host in the restaurant,"Extremely satisfied with a restaurant, food and staff. Boris is one of the nicest person I’ve met in Netherlands. He had made our experience in the restaurant unforgettable and warm. Really grateful for people like Boris who have such dedication to work and who are a reflection of a restaurant and a city in general. The stakes very delicious by the way"
d10461623,June 2022,50,Excellent Grill Variety,This Place was Excellent on Variety of Grill Foods. Taste was magnificent. The Price was not Bad at All. The Service by (Boris) who was our Waiter was phenomenal. I Will Definitely recommend Trying this place out for Yourself . I Will Definitely Go Back There..  Yash. Shantal. Runav and Taharia.
d10461623,June 2022,50,Best Baklava ever!,"The stakes were amazing, the service was excelent but the best were the deserts: baklava and apple pie! Definitely one of the highlights of our trip to Amsterdam!"
d10461623,May 2022,50,One of the best,"An excellent meal. The steak was prepared exactly like I asked for, and on top of that the service and the location were great… highly recommended"
d10461623,May 2022,50,Afternoon Meal was Fantastic,"Hard Rock was full so I used Trip Advisor to find another restaurant not far that would have steak or chicken. My co-worker is not too adventurous. The steaks and prawns were fabulous!! We had some wonderful bread and the roasted vegetables were so fresh. My drink of choice was sangria and it was wonderful, too. I would highly recommend this restaurant. We went around 4 PM and had no reservation."
d10461623,May 2022,50,Nader Grill Steakhouse,"perfect. We order mix grill and chicken perfectly roasted. Waiter was wonderful, I get the impression it was the owner. We will be back, and see you soon"
d10461623,May 2022,50,Delicious perfectly cooked steak and great service,I had a very simple sirloin accompanied by frites and salad. It was perfectly cooked and the salad was fresh and had a delicious dressing. The house wine was acceptable and the services was excellent. Simple and delicious at a great price.
d10461623,May 2022,10,Scammers,"When I came to the restaurant, I asked the owner for tap water. He told me that by law, he couldn't serve tap water in the restaurant. I reluctantly accepted a small bottle of water that cost 3 Euro. Midway through the meal, after my group and I had ordered 100 euro of food, he brought over a large vase of tap water, for free. Either he broke the law in that action, or he scammed me earlier when he said he could not serve tap water. Either way, not the type of place I recommend visiting. The food was also very mediocre and absolutely not worth the price we paid for it. Avoid Grillhouse Nader-mediocre food and dishonest ownership."
d10461623,May 2022,50,"Tasty food, welcoming owner and cozy environment",The title sums it up pretty much! You might be tempted by the platter with the various assortment of meats however I would recommend going for the ribs! Would recommend.
d10461623,May 2022,50,"My wife wanted to go here, thank God I listened","It's not hard to find but it is a small restaurant and easy to bypass. It is a SMALL restaurant so I would suggest making a RSVP. We were lucky and came in around 1700 which is much earlier than locals eat. We ordered the mixed meat platter and a couple of side appetizers. The owner looked at me (I weigh 220lbs) and recommended NOT ordering the appetizers. We wouldn't finish everything. I looked at him incredously and he said if we wanted the appetizers after we ate the mixed plate it would all be on the house. Well, we couldn't eat every delicious meat on the plate and saved some money too! The owner is from Cairo ... which seemed odd to me for the menu but they do an absolutely fantastic job on everything we ate!"
d9796658,October 2022,50,Best pancakes in Amsterdam,Best pancakes iv had in Amsterdam by far would definitely recommend worth the visit. Ordered the mancake best for a savoury treat.
d9796658,October 2022,50,The best pancakes in Amsterdam!,"Tried The Blue Magic Pancakes, sooo good! Fluffy and airy, stuffed with fresh big blueberries, so delicious! I had all the blueberry experience in every bite, it tasted like heaven! Keep in mind to add some extra blueberries over the pancakes, it makes the real difference! The staff was so helpful!"
d9796658,September 2022,40,Pancakes and good vibes,"Very cool atmosphere, staff was very nice. The food was delicious, we ended up trying The Goldigger. Presentation was perfect and the pistachio ice cream was delicious. Overall a great place and will definitely be back!"
d9796658,September 2022,50,Brilliant pancakes,"Between us we had two savory pancakes, vegetarian and smoked salmon, each had a yummy avocado hidden under the hummus and the dill/ creme fraiche. Highly recommended. Good coffee too. Service was a bit hap hazard, waitress forgot to place half our order, but we were not in a rush so we didn't make a fuss. One recommendation would be to have the possibility to order one small sweet pancake, if you have had a savoury one to start. The options on the menu involving 3 pancakes were too much."
d9796658,September 2022,50,Nice and chill,"Very good stuff ! Staff was super friendly and we loved the concept. Very chill, with good tasty pancakes and great drink menu"
d9796658,August 2022,50,Amazing pancakes,"This is the place for the best pancakes in Amsterdam! Amazing staff and delicious food! Good price, you must go"
d9796658,August 2022,50,Delicious pancake variations!,"The food here was great, and they were very accommodating to our large group of 7. I had the pink lady and it was fantastic. Just what we needed after an early flight into town!"
d9796658,August 2022,50,Amazing pancakes,It was very delicious ! The concept is so cool ! The place was very beautiful ! We don’t found it in France and it’s to bad !
d9796658,August 2022,40,wowowow!,"so good! man cake is to die for, and you can’t leave without trying the saffron pistachio ice cream. my only regret is that we didn’t have the stomach to order everything on the menu"
d9796658,August 2022,50,WOW! must try if you like fun pancakes and great atmosphere,"Went here on last day of trip in Amsterdam, and got the man cake and ice ice baby - both incredible!! Super filling and super unique well thought out flavor combinations. The saffron pistachio ice cream is excellent and the decor snd interior is super cute :) would recommend!!"
d9796658,July 2022,50,Ridiculously good,"The pancakes were seriously amazing! It was busy but we got seated quickly, and the pancakes were out super quickly too, thank you Moak 😊 we will definitely come again!"
d9796658,July 2022,10,Discussing Bready mess,"For a pancake place the pancakes are just awful. They are big bread lumps showed with fancy toppings to try and make them look better but just can’t take away from what actually underneath, a horrible pancake. The whole place feels like a gen z attraction shop trying to law in American tourists and failing miserably. Avoid this place at all costs and steer clear when in Amsterdam. You have been warned."
d9796658,July 2022,40,Good pancakes,"Very large Thick Whole meal pancakes with good amount of toppings, you get value for money. Pancakes were good, not the best I’ve ever had though. Don’t be fooled into thinking they are Dutch pancakes as we thought that (they are very American). I would recommend coming as it was a good filling breakfast with good service. Overall it was good."
d9796658,July 2022,50,INCREDIBLE,"Absolutely incredible! You need to come here’. Best selection of pancakes going. sweet or savoury, your choice. Be sure to come here!"
d9796658,July 2022,40,yummy pancakes!,"this was a very cool restaurant with great service, a fun menu, and amazing pancakes!!! it’s a great location (especially for the alps hotel)"
d697045,September 2022,50,"Great restaurant, excellent food",This restaurant was recommended by the owner of Those Dam Boat Guys. What a gem! The menu was explained by the excellent staff and I have to say the food when it arrived was mouthwatering - cooked to perfection. We arrived reasonably early but realised very quickly that we were lucky to get a table as by the time we left there were a number of people waiting to get in.
d697045,September 2022,50,Excellent food and atmosphere,"Excellent food, good service in a nice setting. ‘Gezellig’ as we say. We enjoyed the menu and the wines. If you want to go to a non tourist restaurant, this is a nice place to go"
d697045,August 2022,50,Great food and experience,"The best meal we had in Amsterdam! The staff were so friendly and lovely and the food varied and delicious. They don't take reservations so we walked in and they offered us a seat at the small bar, which serves great local beers as well as wine and spirits, for about ten minutes or so until a table was available. Then the menu was recited to us and our orders taken from memory. While we ate our excellent starters and mains we could see the very enticing selection of desserts on the counter behind us, so we couldn't resist getting some of those too! I and my partner are vegetarian and had great options, as did the two meat eaters wirh us. A brilliant evening in every respect."
d697045,August 2022,50,Mamma knows best!,Had a wonderful experience at this authentic venue. Decor is beautiful and staff are amazing. Asked for recommendations and mamma knew best! Asked the right questions and was spot on with her suggestions. Wonderful food. Great atmosphere and great value for money. We’re only in the city for 2 days and I may well come back here tomorrow.
d697045,August 2022,50,Wonderful!,Excellent food and service. Live the concept of no fixed menu and the owner sat down and reviewed the dishes of the day. Fast service and friendly. Great mix of locals and tourists. Small restaurant but with ample seating and short wait time for a solo. Will be coming back with a larger group.
d697045,August 2022,40,Fab little find,"Happened to find this place by chance, the food was superb. The waiter recites the menu, so nothing is printed to read. But the 3 guys serving were all so helpful, the steak was very tasty and the pear desert (made by the owners mother) was superb.  The value of the meal also surprised me, head and shoulders above anywhere else I ate at during my stay."
d697045,August 2022,50,Definitely worth a visit,"Went to this restaurant after reading the reviews, well it was certainly worth it.  Staff were fantastic, very welcoming, we chatted with them whilst at the bar waiting for our table.  The food well, I would show you pictures, however we were so busy enjoying it that the only pictures we actually took were of empty plates. The four of us had various dishes, including a fish dish with the fish so fresh, it was to die for. The chicken in coconut sauce was so tasty, it was to be savoured. The Steak with Strawberry sauce with Goats cheese, was a wonder.    Deserts were also terrific, plus a nice coffee to end.    Be patient with the team, it gets busy, so you might be lucky to get a table straight away, if not it is worth sitting at the bar until a table becomes available. They do not take bookings.    A meal not to forget, thank you."
d697045,August 2022,50,Hidden gem,"One of the best meals I’ve had I in awhile, and definitely the best mussels I’ve had in my whole life. We ordered several starters and loved everything. Great setting, yummy drinks, fabulous food, and super friendly service. If you’re looking for a cozy dinner in the middle of a hectic city, this is your place!"
d697045,June 2022,50,"Love, love, love!!!","A gorgeous, family run restaurant in the heart of Amsterdam. The food was utterly delicious and the service friendly and efficient. An absolute find!"
d697045,July 2022,50,Fabulous,"We had a fabulous early dinner here - mussels, smoked mackerel mousse, Dutch style steak, hake, pear cake accompanied by Pinot Grigio. Service was perfect."
d697045,July 2022,50,An authentic family owned restaurant,"We found this restaurant online while searching for restaurants for a birthday meal. Lovely building and environment inside and out. Service was outstanding from start to finish. The waitress explained the menu in detail, describing the dishes, listening to our preferences and recommending us the most appropriate dish. It was evident that the waitress was passionate about her city, her restaurant and the food they were serving. Excellent food. Will be returning on my next visit to Amsterdam and would recommend to anyone visiting the city."
d697045,July 2022,40,What a find!,Such a lovely and welcome place! Friendly staff and beautiful food!  The mussels is a must …. Try the signature dish of steak with strawberry sauce and goats cheese!  The only issue could be … the chicken curry dish was chicken on the bone… this was no issue for us but could be for others and we never thought about asking ….  Lovely restaurant - glad we walked down the road and found a table!
d697045,June 2022,40,A nice place to go,Nice food and good vibe. The restaurant doesn’t have a menu but the owner will explain. We had the shrimps and the tortilla for starter and both were nice dishes. Very tender chicken for main course. The staff is friendly and service minded. A nice place to go
d697045,May 2022,10,"Shockingly rude service, completely unwarranted","Waited for an hour, of which the service by an Italian lady was quite pleasant (but long), only to be seated inside with a Dutch middle-aged female server who didn't like our choice of having a mix of starters and main courses.  Literally said ""We are a restaurant, not fast-food"" and if we wanted to continue to eat there, we had to take two starters before we were allowed to order main courses...thus we walked out.  Bizarre, condescending, Faulty Towers type of behavior from a server...not worth the bad experience."
d697045,May 2022,50,Amazing food near Dam Square,"What’s wonderful find in Amsterdam. Less than a block from our hotel and so cute! The food and the staff were so great we went back twice. The place is small and you may have to wait, but it’s worth it. We had steaks one night (amazing), and mussels and Indonesian meatloaf the 2nd time. Great food and great prices. PS: don’t skip dessert!"
d8092753,October 2022,30,Nice but sit outside if you any to converse.,"Food nice, not exceptional.  Excessively loud music and though we were the only guests inside the restaurant, our request to dim it down a bit was met with an eye-roll when our very nice and friendly server asked the rather disinterested woman in charge to turn it down. Two minutes later the music was put on in full again.  Take it ear plugs to go into the loo as the speakers are at maximum strength there n the confined space."
d8092753,August 2022,50,Love this place!,"We found this restaurant on a review site while visiting Amsterdam. It was absolutely perfect. Delicious food, warm and welcoming staff, lovely cute atmosphere. We really loved it and the neighborhood is beautiful to explore. Highly recommend."
d8092753,August 2022,20,Very disappointing.,"I came here with high expectations due to what I read on various social media. First of all, we waited 40 minutes for our food but all the stuff they do is clearly prepared beforehand (I won’t believe they make hummus or falafels on the spot). The food itself was quite good (although nothing exceptional) but way too overpriced. The worst part was the eggplant: 10,50€ for one roasted eggplant with some tahini is really unacceptable and ridiculous. Portions are not that big. Honestly would not come back."
d8092753,August 2022,50,Excellent,"Excellent friendly staff. Food was outstanding very tasty. The food was very well presented, the tapwater was free! And refillable. The portions are very generous and although you only get three pitta breads that is more than enough. if you want excellent value for money and you like Hummus this is the place for you. We will definitely return here if we are ever in Amsterdam again."
d8092753,July 2022,50,Tasty mediterranean restaurant in Jordaan,This was one of the great surprises of the trip. We had it on our list before going and they delivered. The food was tasty and well prepared and the staff was friendly. The price was good and the experience was just top-notch.    They had both indoor and outdoor seating. The only complaint was that the music was too loud inside.
d8092753,July 2022,50,So good we had to go twice,Stumbled upon this place for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Greeted by the lovely doggy host on arrival we grabbed a seat in the garden. I had the shakshouka which was delicious and my friend also enjoyed the hummus cauliflower.    We enjoyed it so much we went the next day and I tried the hummus this time… so delicious!    Next time I’m in Amsterdam I’ll be sure to visit.
d8092753,July 2022,50,Greatly recommended,"Great service, a very cozy setting and absolutely amazing food. If your in Amsterdam, treat yourself to an all-round wonderful experience."
d8092753,July 2022,50,Hidden gem,"Extremely friendly staff and amazing food quality. One of the best hummus I ever had, vegan friendly as well and a nice location."
d8092753,July 2022,50,Craving falafel,I think that’s the best falafel I ever had. The side salads were all really tasty too. Everything we ordered was great. It was a great choice for authentic food in a pleasant casual setting.
d8092753,May 2022,40,Lunch in Amsterdam,"Lovely Israeli food. Highly recommend for lunch. Very tasty hummus based plates, lots of choice & would definitely recommend when visiting Amsterdam."
d8092753,May 2022,50,Good Israeli food,We visited the one on Maastraat for lunch. The dishes were really good and the service helpfull and friendly. We will definitely come back!
d8092753,April 2022,50,Hummus,Great 👍🏾 yeasty and great service The hummus is good and the siniya is great Thank you for tasty food
d8092753,June 2021,50,Simply great !,The food was super tasty and well presented. Friendly helpful staff and good prize. Excelent all around. Have been there multiple times
d8092753,April 2022,40,Lovely israeli food,Really enjoyed the atmosphere and our lunch in this Israeli bistro. Hummus was plentiful and creamy with fresh pita and lots of different condiments packed with flavour. Friendly service too!
d8092753,November 2021,10,A PIECE OF BROKEN GLASS IN THE FOOD,"Worst experience of my life. While eating one of their spreads I found A PIECE OF BROKEN GLASS the size of a little finger nail inside my mouth. Luckily enough I bit it and my tooth did not break but imagine I had swollen it... yes, I could have died! Obviously I was so in shock I did not touch anything from that meal again. Pieces of glass inside food at restaurants can happen.... they say. The manager came to say sorry. WORST PART? They tried to make me pay the full bill!!!!!!! after complaining they eventually just took 10€ off the whole bill of 47€. When you mess up, you at least try to make up for it the best possible way right? Not here, they don’t care about how their customers feel apparently, they’re just too greedy. BIG BIG BIG SHAME"
d696917,September 2022,50,"Amazing experience, incredible food","I came here on my birthday and my first day in Amsterdam. After a missed flight I practically had to sprint there to make my reservation, and I am SO happy I did. Every single bite was incredible. I ate foods I would never normally order and I enjoyed every single dish. I tried to take photos of each course, as they were artfully prepared. However, with that in mind between courses, I don't think I managed to take even one photo without taking a bite first, I was just too excited for what they had in store. Also, I felt great after eating this meal. The menu on the day I came was mostly plant-based, filling, and absolutely delicious!!! It energized me to explore beautiful Amsterdam. I cannot recommend De Kas enough. The staff was exceptional and gave me a small pot of honey to make my birthday even ""sweeter."" It will always be a great memory."
d696917,September 2022,40,"Interesting, tasty and great experience","Great food, beautifully presented with helpful,pleasant staff- certainly recommend: definitely a super experience and lively location"
d696917,August 2022,50,Amazing food and environment,"Such a great experience, we had the five-course menu and everything was delicious, each dish was creative and unique. Definitely recommend De Kas when in Amsterdam!"
d696917,August 2022,50,"Wonderful food, fresh ingredients, awesome staff","AMAZING! This was my first time at a restaurant with a set number of courses etc. first of all, the location is beautiful. It is located outside of the city center within a beautiful park.    The staff were incredibly nice and took the time to explain the restaurant concept to us as well as its history.    My favorite was the mussels and the unique ice cream at the end.    The many little dishes and unique combinations forced me to try things that I wouldn’t usually try and I was blown away by the taste of them.    I highly recommend the restaurant to any visitors that want a unique dining experience full of interesting and delicious food.    The inside of the restaurant was also lovely. I noticed that many locals dine there in addition to other English speaking tourists. It’s a great break from the very touristy central Amsterdam."
d696917,August 2022,50,Fabulous experience outside of Amsterdam's center,"The term ""farm to table"" is the most misused adjective in the restaurant industry. However in the case of De Kas it is apt given you are eating within their vast setting where most of their food comes from. The four course luncheon menu was appropriately light for a midday meal and each course was nicely prepared and the food was superb especially the sauces (I am a big sauce guy). A must go"
d696917,July 2022,50,Quality time with family,Super fresh ingredients from the greenhouse. The service from Rodney was excellent! Great ambiance! The celebration of our daughter’s (bachelor) graduation was a great success.
d696917,June 2022,50,De Kas..Michelin one star experience not to be missed,"I found De Kas while researching things to do in Amsterdam and was fortunate to do so. The restaurant experience is not to be missed if you are looking for a unique dining experience. The menu is based on the daily harvest from the restaurants farm and greenhouse. We were treated to the first tomatoes of the season which were prepared with lemon zest, olive oil and basil--very refreshing!The plates are culinary art with unique use of the fresh produce. The service is first class with explanations of each course. A wide variety of wines are available to complement the meal. The homemade lemoncello is not to be missed. De Kas is in an oasis from the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam. We had a 1330 lunch reservation and did not leave until 1645...which included a walk through the greenhouse. De Kas is now a one star Michelin restaurant and not to be missed."
d696917,June 2022,50,A highlight - picked in the morning on the plate by evening,"What a classic / fun / unusual and delicious dinner. I can’t wait to return in a different season to experience what the kitchen puts out in the fall / winter / spring. At the height of summer, they do amazing things with local produce - just a terrific evening."
d696917,June 2022,50,A nice experience,"The food, the service and the atmosphere of the place are exceptional. A little bit overpriced but all in all it was a great experience. The menu is fixed so you will have your courses in appetizers served one by one and as my friend (local to Amsterdam) it changes everyday."
d696917,May 2022,50,Amazing food,"One of the most memorable meals we've had, each dish was fantastic and beautifully presented. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Most of the vegetables they serve are grown in their our greenhouse, which you can walk through, and the gardens around the restaurant are also beautiful."
d696917,April 2022,50,Never Misses A Beat!! Amazing,"My absolute favourite restaurant in Amsterdam, I've been many many times, and it honestly never misses a beat. The food, service and interior are always outstanding. They cater super well to my GF needs and their focus on seasonal local produce is perfect. I love to come for lunch since you can soak in the weather floating by outside, however the evening with all the pretty lights is also beautiful! See you again soon, I am sure!"
d696917,April 2022,50,Nice spot,All good. Service great.menu special. Time to serve very ok. Very nice place. Nice ambience. Nice location. The service was great.
d696917,April 2022,30,"Boring food, great ambiance","Amazing entourage and nice and attentive staff, but a boring menu. It feels they prioritized optics above substance; all courses are pieces of art, but the actual taste and combinations were boring and bland. With fresh produce grown around the restaurant I expected more creativity. I can appreciate vegan and vegetarian food; when done right you don’t miss fish or meat at all, but in this case I felt I was being served side dishes to a nice piece of meat or fish that wasn’t there.    Also the sequence of courses didn’t seem to tell a story of build-up with a head and tail. It felt like a random selection of plates.    Unfortunately this is my experience with “posh” Dutch restaurants in general; “priegelwerk” (tinkering with tiny bits and pieces) but no real substance to it. Pretentious. After 6 courses I was still hungry because I don’t want to fill myself up with bread to compensate, and didn’t remember a single course except the desert which was nice.    Wines were excellent."
d696917,March 2022,50,Relax - You are in for a treat,"Walk into the park, past the storks nesting on top of the huge chimney and enter another world.  Amazing service that settles you into this different zone and then fresh, colourful delicious food will follow. Intense flavours and good textures and all presented like works of art."
d696917,March 2022,50,Fantastic food in a spectacular setting,"Fantastic meal in a beautiful setting. The food is delicious, beautifully presented and inventive. The service is wonderful. A breathtaking setting with the greenhouse adjacent. A must if you are in Amsterdam"
