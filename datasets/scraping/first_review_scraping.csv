d11752080,October 2022,50,Great Food and Friendly Hosts,We enjoyed meeting Martine and Olav. They prepared a delicious meal and we had a wonderful time. I will recommend this experience to my friends.
d11752080,October 2022,50,Birthday diner,The food and ambiance were fantastic! What a nice concept ....! I would recommend it for sure! More private and cosy than in normal restaurants!
d11752080,October 2022,50,Veal cheeks !,"We were welcomed into the lovely home of martine and olav and we met our fellow diners from Missouri. Their home is beautifully located on a canal with a fascinating history.    The food was brilliant! We tasted some juniper liquor with our petit bites. Martine took special care to cater my my gluten free diet and my husband’s distaste for cucumbers! A warm squash soup with a hinto of curry followed that. If I had known veal cheeks were going to be the main event, I would’ve saved more room, for the main course was exquisite! Dessert was highly unexpected passion fruit mousse with meringue and caramel sauce. We enjoyed some delicious Rhône wines from France.    The atmosphere was relaxed and informal. Olav is very knowledgeable about many subjects, but particularly the architecture of the buildings in the neighborhood. The couple alternated positions at the table so we were able to get to know both of them.    What I like most about the experience was to see what a Dutch home feels like from the inside and to taste from delicious food and wine served in a gracious but informal setting."
d11752080,July 2022,50,Great evening in Amsterdam,"Highly recommend dinner with Martine and Olaf. They prepared a delicious multi course meal that included many local specialties. Wine accompanied each course. While one host was preparing a course, the other host shared local history, things to do, restaurant suggestions and answers to all our questions. They were great hosts. It was a fun evening.  If you have dinner at Martine’s Table at the beginning of your Amsterdam visit, ask Olaf about the private tours he gives. He is a wealth of information.  Our group was made up of two couples. We were joined by a father and son."
d11752080,June 2022,50,unique experience,Lovely and talented couple entertaining guests in their charming city apartment venue. Excellent multi-course meal of local fare paired with wines and digestif's. A very fun evening in a wonderful city.
d11752080,August 2022,50,“Amazing Dutch Hospitality”,"My wife and i were visiting Amsterdam prior to a cruise. as we were here back in 2014, and saw all the typical sites, i was looking for something different and more personnel. Martine, and her husband Olav showed up in trip advisor under a section related to eating at a locals house. that was the something different i was looking for. before i booked, I read the reviews, and started the booking through Trip Advisor. it took me to a webpage Eatwith where i made the reservation and the payment. Martine, then contacted me through the website (Very user friendly). she asked about any food allergies.    We arrived at their home overlooking a very old cannel. we were joined by two other couples. As both Martine, and Olav are chef's they shared the cooking. while the food was amazing, the hosts made the evening. they were both so warm and friendly, with great stories. The 3 hours flew by.    as for the food, one of the best meals i have ever eaten. It started with a toast of an old Dutch liqueur, then came the appetizers, including a mushroom ragout tart, cheese paired with pickled ginger, an amazing deviled egg and a local sausage. This was paired with a nice white wine. Then came a wonderful salad with shredded smoked mackerel. The main course, was a ground up pork sausage wrapped in bacon, with two types of mashed potatoes. one was made with bacon bits, and endive. the other with carrots, and grilled onions. both were so good, we all asked for the recipe. this was paired with a nice red wine. desert was a French toast made with a special local bread. It included, a homemade berry compote, and a special yogurt.    In addition to the Dutch meal, they also have a French meal option.    As a side, Olav is a local tour guide. we hired him for a wonderful localized tour in the AM. lots of insight that you don't usually get."
d11752080,April 2022,50,The first dinner with family after arrival at Amsterdam,Our family enjoyed a warm dinner at Martine's home after our first arrival at Amsterdam. The food was amazing and the wine was good too. We will book Martine of Martine's Table when we visit Amsterdam again.
d11752080,December 2021,50,Excellent Dining Experience,"Excellent Amsterdam dining experience! Highly recommend especially if you want to eat good food with a local chef in their home with other diners. The hosts were affable, great conversationalists and the meal was excellent, which included several courses with choices, dessert, beverages including wines&apéritifs. 4 couples & hosts couple made a great dinner for 10. Late posting this experience took place April 2019"
d11752080,August 2022,50,A Very Special Evening,"We enjoyed an excellent meal, interesting conversations, great wine selections, a special treat of Genever, as well as some fascinating personal stories that Olav and Martine shared with us. If you are visiting Amsterdam and want a personal experience in a lovely home with fantastic food, then this is not to be missed. Highly recommend."
d11752080,August 2022,50,One of the highlights of our trip!,"What a wonderful evening we recently spent with Martine and Olav! They were so welcoming and did a wonderful job hosting us in their home, alternating between cooking and conversing with us. We learned so many interesting things about Amsterdam as well as personal stories from Martine and Olav. We were even lucky enough to hear some of their music. We enjoyed great food and conversation. The evening was definitely one of the highlights of our trip! Many thanks to Martine and Olav for hosting us and creating such a special experience!"
d11752080,August 2022,50,Felt like a family dinner with a French chef hosting. Olaf and Martine hosted our group of six (3 couples).,"After a Baltic cruise we (3 couples) decided to visit Amsterdam. The highlight was our home cooked meal hosted by Martine and her husband Olaf at their home in Old Amsterdam. Lovely couple who welcomed us warmly. The food (French cuisine) was wonderfully cooked and presented. The conversation was easily flowing as we learned more about them and vice versa.    After eating on the ship and restaurants in Amsterdam, it was fantastic to have a home cooked meal. And to do it in a real Dutch home was the icing on a pretty great cake."

d11752080,August 2022,50,Amsterdam Dinner and birthday celebration,Martine and Ulav provided a wonderful dinner experience that will not be forgotten. The simple but delectable fare started with a selection of appetizers paired with a lovely white wine and then advanced to a wonderful meal and dessert. The laughter was contagious and the sharing of music afterward made us feel at home... This is definitely a treat when in Amsterdam that I hope to experience again and would strongly recommend!!
d11752080,July 2022,50,Wonderful,"Great dinner, with wonderful hosts. The food was the best dinner we had on our three days in Amsterdam. We were four adults and there were two others who added to our great conversation at the table."
d11752080,July 2022,50,Pure joy!,"We had an amazing evening with Martine and Olav! Such great hosts and interesting persons! We spent few hours in a relaxing, cozy and friendly atmosphere. Telling stories and listening to them while enjoying absolutely fantastic dishes."
d693419,October 2022,50,"Superb food, service and atmosphere","This is not a cheap dining experience, but it surpassed all our expectations. Everything was delicious, the wine pairing was extremely fine and also in generous measures. The staff were delightful. In short, we can't recommend it enough.More"
d693419,April 2022,50,De Silveren Spiegel is a must stop. 5/5.,One word ‘WOW.’ De Silveren Spiegel is a must stop if you are looking for that extra special something on your trip to Amsterdam. The best fine dining experience we have had anywhere in the world. The staff and food were amazing.More

d693419,October 2022,50,"Superb food and wine pairing, incredibly professional and a great sense of humor.","Magnificent building, creative and colorful food. Superb service. They really want your evening to be special. When my partner did not finish her trout starter in the six course tasting menu they offered her an alternative. Excellent tasting menu with a global wine pairing of high quality wines that perfectly matched each course."
d693419,October 2022,50,This was many second visit in the last several months—I was very impressed the first and again this time—a special place,"Enjoyed another fantastic dinner last night with friends—the atmosphere, quality of the food and service was outstanding as usual..see you in November."
d693419,October 2022,50,Wonderful restaurant in a unique setting,We were here on October 22 for lunch with friends. This was the first time we visited this restaurant although we are from the Amsterdam area. We were more than pleasantly surprised about everything. The ambiance is spectacular and unique. The service outstanding and very friendly. And the 4 courses we had were all outstanding. We can highly recommend this restaurant.
d693419,October 2022,50,Definitely Michelin worthy,"7 courses for $120 PPerson. Each item beautifully prepared The entrees were monkfish, veal and duck all perfectly presented . The pre dessert was served on a ceramic pillow. The dessert was chocolate in about 6 forms."
d693419,October 2022,50,Magical dining in Amsterdam,"We absolutely loved our special 25th wedding anniversary (appropriately, Silver anniversary) dinner celebration at De Silveren Spiegel.  We really enjoyed the Silver & Gold Spiegel Michelin special. It’s an 8 course, 8 wine pairing culinary fantasia, set in a historic fairy tale cottage dating from the 1600’s.  It all starts with a champagne cocktail mixed with silver water (real silver in the water). Also, fresh baked and warm sourdough bread with a wonderful and distinct local sourdough flavor apart from what we know of sourdough bread being that we’re from San Francisco.  The service was impeccable and the entire staff is thoughtfully choreographed and graceful.  The wonderful flavors, textures and artful presentations of each dish is so well executed by Yves Van Der Hoff, we think this young chef exhibits all the hallmarks of the worlds best chefs.  This destination restaurant is (family) owned and managed and the wine curated by Yves father, Mr. Van Der Hoff, who is clearly a positive influence on his son and the exceptional experience you will have when you visit. The family Van Der Hoff should be very proud for what they've created."
d693419,October 2022,50,An Explosion of Flavour,My partner and I were very surprised of how good the food was. The ingredients fit perfectly together and guarantee a taste explosion! The mixture of different textures was just excellent. The service was amazing. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. It was a really great experience!
d693419,October 2022,50,Amazing food experience,We had an amazing food experience in this restaurant! We went for the 7 course Duck menu and it was great. Definitely Michelin star deserving (Michelin Guide 2022). Our sever Chris was very good and the wine pairing he proposed was excellent! As foodies we recommend this restaurant wholeheartedly!
d693419,October 2022,50,An extraordinary experience,"The place set the perfect scene - with its exclusive sourroundings - for an unforgettable dining experience. The service was outstanding, the food was incredible. Thank you so much - we will come back for sure"
d693419,October 2022,50,BEST FOOD I EVER TASTED,"I’ve been here 18/10-2022 and I had the best possible experience ever!!  The staff was so nice and the food was to die for!  This is the best food I’ve had.  I would recommend this to any and everybody, I feel everyone should have an experience like this!  10/10 - no doubt!"
d693419,October 2022,50,Very nice experience,"We booked this place some months ago, based on the recommendations.  And these were well deserved.  Very friendly and funny staff, that greeted us, before we entered.  Serving, story about the place and most importantly food and wine where excellent.  We had the ""Silver & Golden Spiegel Michelin Special"", and it was the right decision.  We definitely can recommend a visit here."
d1239229,November 2022,50,Fantastic,Fantastic food. Some of the best oysters I have ever had. Impeccable service and very good atmosphere all around. Excellent
d1239229,October 2022,50,#1,"How anyone could only give this georgous restaurant 5 stars is beyond me. Because it should have 500 stars. From the second you are seated, you know you are off on an experience. Endless courses of culinary perfection are transported from farm to table with military precision. Each course served on or in a unique plate, bowl or marble pedistal. Each dish has flavours exploding on your palette. At the end of the evening, the chef comes out from under his staircase layer to greet his guests. Like an old friend, he has communicated his vocabulary with food. This is hands down, one of the top 3 meals of my life. Oh, change that, make it the #1!!"
d1239229,September 2022,50,Outstanding,"I have been lucky enough to eat in many of the world's best restaurants and our meal at Vinkeles was right up there. Classical with a Japanese twist, and very, very well executed.    Great value for money when you think about the work that has gone in to preparing the food (and the idea of doing the wine flight in half glasses is great one that others could learn from)."
d1239229,September 2022,50,Fantastic food and excellent service,"A stunning set of innovative dishes, accompanied by excellent service in a great environment. One of the best, if not the best, restaurants we have visited. Not cheap, but the quality matches the price."
d1239229,June 2022,50,Definitely 2 stars on its way,"Our second visit to this restaurant and we wondered again, how come that this restaurant hasn’t earned its 2nd Michelin star yet !  The venue is super beautiful and luxurious, the staff and service are impeccable.  The food is out of this world where we enjoyed every single bite and dish  Vinkeles is all about art, excellence and dedication to ingredients and creativity  Can wait for our next visit"
d1239229,May 2022,10,Birthday disaster,"I booked a table for 8 to celebrate my birthday with my family visiting from abroad. I got the attached email confirming my reservation and asking me to please arrive on time. When we arrived with the whole group there was no reservation. The manager came out and tried to argue that the email I received saying my reservation was confirmed, was in reality not a final reservation, and that she could see on her system that someone had contacted me. Unfortunately no one did. Not a single email or phone call. A Michelin star should be way more than what happens in the kitchen. It’s about service and customer experience. This restaurant definitely does not deserve a star. Thank you for ruining my 45th birthday dinner."
d1239229,December 2021,50,Excellent execution,"Due to the lockdown in Amsterdam, our original dinner reservation of 7pm became 5pm, and then eventually a late lunch at 1.30pm. The restaurant handled these developments very well and kept us updated all the way.  The food was how we remembered it to be, well executed and special mention to the pigeon dish that was as tender and delicious as it was when we had it years ago. The food and wine pairing offered excellent value and I would strongly recommend the diner partakes in this. Service was warm without being intrusive; we left happy and full and will definitely be back the next time we pass through Amsterdam."
d1239229,October 2021,20,Disappointing dinner,"Considering that we are talking about a 1 star restaurant, we had a really disappointing experience.  Main problem, our table was outside the main room, close to the stairs/exit, with the waiters turning their backs on us and continuously passing by our table talking and coordinating.  We made the reservation 2 months before, so this was non acceptable.  When we told them about the uncomfortable situation they replied telling us that one was one of the best tables, far from the noise. Not acceptable at all as an answer, apologies would have been better.  The service for a 1 star was below the average, a waiter made funny comments on our empty plates 3 times, again not acceptable.  Food: few great dishes and many other really even not sufficient...on average a lot below expectations.  Would I suggest this restaurant? Not at all, in Amsterdam there are 1 star restaurants much better than this one."
d1239229,September 2021,50,Fantastic!,"Absolutely delicious, creative food and they catered thoughtfully for my no fish/seafood requirements. The room is beautiful - I think it is an old bakery and some of the features have been preserved. Definitely a place for a special occasion and a memorable meal. I will definitely go back!"
d1239229,September 2021,50,Excellent food and wine pairing,This was our second visit to Vinkeles and wanted to see if its still as good as 4 years ago. We were blown away again. 3 amuses and 6 courses - all very nice and flavorful.    We liked the first 2 courses the most - the wine pairing was 101% on the spot there.  The sommelier explains each wine in detail without rushing it.    Vinkeles compares very favorably against other 1-star places we have dined in.
d1239229,September 2021,50,Elegant atmosphere and delicious menu,"We had the opportunity to be at restaurant Vinkeles for a 6 gang menu experience. The plates served by the chef and its team were simply delicious , the service excellent, the stuff friendly and the atmosphere unique.    We are highly recommending to book a table the next time you visit Amsterdam."
d1239229,December 2020,50,Awesome experience,"We had the 7 course chef's menu yesterday and we had an awesome evening. Really knowledgeable staff, superfriendly and great service. The dishes were well balanced and exciting. Great local produce too! Wine pairing was spot on! Really an evening to remember!"
d1239229,July 2020,50,Interesting and elegant,At the level we expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant. The menu is daring and Asian-inspired. Could be a bit too eclectic for a classic palate though.
d1239229,December 2019,50,Perfect for our last night,"The venue is beautiful, warm and elegant at the same time, staff is polite, helpful and not intruding. Modern cuisine with a wild flair, tasting menu rich of flavors, it was such a delight to end our trip at this amazing restaurant"
d1239229,February 2020,50,Fantastic venue,We have just celebrated my wife’s birthday at Vinkeles and had a lovely evening. The staff were very welcoming and attended to us with friendliness without being overbearing. The food was fantastic and the dish combinations were inspired - I would never have considered serving chocolate with paté! The wine choice was varied and complemented the food well. I would definitely recommend.
d6864170,October 2022,10,Undeserving of any Michelin Stars,"To say I’m disappointed is an understatement. How this establishment has 2 Michelin stars is beyond me. When I go to a Michelin star restaurant, I expect everything from the service, cleanliness, taste, and more to be immaculate and as close to perfection as possible. I have travelled to over 40 countries and have eaten at some of the best restaurants in the world. My expectations were surely not met here.    When we arrived, there were two gentlemen at the front who were extremely kind and set the tone for the evening. However, our waiter made our evening take a turn.    I had booked our reservation 2 months in advance and the restaurant was well aware of dietary preferences and restrictions, yet they were still confused and unsure. Asking me more questions demonstrated that they were unprepared. 2 of the guests were vegan and instead of feeling welcomed, we felt as if we were a burden for the restaurant.    The waiter proceeded to explain how there was one dish with parmesan cheese that could not be altered. Why were we not notified of this beforehand in the 2 months we planned the visit? The waiter said “I hope this small piece of cheese isn’t a problem for you”. Maybe the staff has to undergo some training on one of the most prevalent lifestyles out there which is veganism. Veganism is an ethical choice and we don’t sway back and forth when it’s convenient. They didn’t have a vegan menu prepared and proceeded to tell us that they would give us extra bread and an additional desert to make sure we don’t go home hungry. We were appalled at this. We are going to pay 200 euros to get extra bread and not get a full comprehensive menu that has been carefully crafted?    Aside from the food, the service was slow. It took them over 30 minutes to bring us some water that we requested. They also made a mistake in the second dish and gave the vegans the non vegan dishes which in a Michelin star establishment is completely unacceptable.    There are no room for mistakes especially of that magnitude. Don’t make it seem as if you are prepared to serve vegans when really you’re only prepared to serve vegetarians.    The couch we were sitting on was full of crumbs which also is not acceptable in such a highly rated restaurant. The waiters kept trying to justify their mistakes instead of accepting them and apologizing. They claimed they were joking with us and whatnot, but I don’t go out for this kind of experience to have people joke about my lifestyle, or choices.    This was supposed to be my mother’s early Christmas present who was visiting me all the way from Miami. We were all so disappointed with the service and treatment. I demanded to get my deposit back which they proceeded to honor and we left before being served the remainder of the menu. While I appreciate the team trying to find us a table elsewhere, the experience left a bad taste in our mouths and we just wanted to go home. I will be sure to reach out to Michelin because a place like this does not deserve two stars."
d6864170,May 2022,50,"Possibly the best restaurant in Amsterdam, extremely creative","Located in an obviously posh setting but with laidback service and atmosphere, spectrum will either blow you away or leave you dissapointed. The flavors are bold, refined and outspoken however some dishes are fairly experimental, which will be experienced differently by people. It is the only restaurant of this caliber where I've seen dishes being sent back by guests, which might also be a product of it being in a posh hotel where guests just have their dinner there instead of making a trip out there to eat.    The staff was laid back and knowledgable, making this visit an interesting and pleasant experience."
d6864170,June 2022,50,A marvelous experience,"I visited this restaurant with my partner for our 3-years anniversary.    This restaurant is, quite literally, a hidden gem. Indeed, it is nested deep into the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. From the very beginning when the hostess will greet you at the door you will feel warmly welcomed.    The service is without hesitation the very best service I have experienced among all the Michelin starred restaurants I have been to, surpassing even 3-stars rated establishments. The staff is caring, extremely precise and polite without being invasive. We had a couple of wonderful chats with Cas, the sommelier, who gave us very interesting insights about the wines served in the pairing.    The atmosphere is intimate yet very luminous, with the Amsterdam summer light infusing through the large windows until quite late in the evening (this was on June 18th). The inner garden of the Waldorf Astoria, in which we took a short walk to have a smoke, is also a very nice place.    The menu is very imaginative and every dish offers a unique, incredible and harmonious taste. My personal favorite was the blue lobster with duck tongue, foie gras and green apple juice, probably among the best dishes I have ever had the chance to experience in my life.    The wine pairing was exquisite, the wines are quite unique and a lot of research has been done to find the pairings. one of which was next to impossible: the lamb with oyster and asparagus dish pairing was spot-on, featuring a red wine which had both the structure to accompany the lamb and the lightness to preserve the oyster's finesse. I want to especially thank and compliment the sommelier who told us wonderful stories about the wines served.    In order not to spoil the surprise for future guests I will only say that there is a little something after the dessert which is really interesting.    Overall: an oustanding experience, I'd like to warmly thank the whole team at Spectrum for such an excellent evening and experience. Will definitely come back next time I will be visiting Amsterdam."
d6864170,June 2022,30,Too experimental,"With all this good reviews, I have to say it might be too complex for me to understand the food in this restaurant , maybe it’s far more advanced to my taste buds to grasp , I don’t know ! I dined in 3 and 2 Michelin stars all around the world and it’s by far the most irritating and disappointing experience I have had in a Michelin star establishment despite impeccable service and superb wine.    Every single dish was very promising until this weird experimental ingredient comes and ruins the dish for us, too much ingredients and complexity but without giving the ultimate taste or amusement to our taste buds .. every single dish had something off in it, I know how dedicated the chef and the staff are, but unfortunately this what we all 4 felt    Wine was exceptional, although sommelier forgot to explain for us the last two wines for our lamb and duck    My analysis is that this restaurant is too bold and experimental but they overdo it in the kitchen and with the choice of weird ingredients that didn’t pull it off    Watermelon pistachio and horse reddish  Mackerel with black pudding  Shrimps with short ribs and water melon and ginger  Fish with beetroot  Truffle with apricot  Duck pomegranate and black olives  Lobster and green apple sauce  There much better places to eat in Amsterdam, but again the service and the staff were imoacdable"
d6864170,May 2022,40,The best dining in Amsterdam,"The quality is about the same as four years ago, maybe not quite as inventive. The staff makes a certain round in the restaurant to inspect the tables. They could be less obvious about it. There are some oddities in the wine pairing."
d6864170,March 2022,50,Heaven on earth,Wow. It was special evening. We found the best restaurant experience on the world in Spectrum! Was there Picasso and Van Gogh cooking? I saw and taste something unbelievable and I would give to this place 3 Michelin stars any given sunday. Respect and thank you♥️
d6864170,May 2021,50,Simply the best in the Netherlands,"Just one comment. How do you make a desert with strawberries, sling beans and dille and make it the best desert ever tasted. Go to spectrum a two star that deserves to have three."
d6864170,January 2020,50,Possibly the Best Meal I've Ever Had!,"This restaurant is absolutely fantastic. So much care is put into every detail resulting in some of the best food I've ever tasted.  We had the full fine dining experience, made up of 10 courses, so that we could enjoy this restaurant to its fullest potential. This consisted of 4 rounds of amuse bouches, 6 mains and 8 small desserts.⁣ The menu is a Dutch-East Asian fusion, with the duck especially being inspired by Chinese cuisine.  The dishes served up are fun and different, especially the desserts such as avocado sorbet (my favorite course) and a set of six chocolates that are flavoured like previous courses to remind you of them (how cool is that?!). ⁣Every detail has so much care put into it, even ranging to the homemade butter, which comes in 4 different flavors. Staff is professional, yet warm and friendly, tending to our every need.⁣ The restaurant truly leaves a great impression and a full stomach. Every aspect of our meal was fantastic and this may be the best meal I've ever had."
d6864170,November 2020,50,Great anniversary dinner experience,"We were celebrating our anniversary and what better way to do that than a great dinner at Spectrum and spending the night at the Waldorf Astoria afterwards. With the current Covid restrictions it’s the best way to make great memories. We appreciated the card signed by the Spectrum team.    We arrived late afternoon and were seated in the corner of the restaurant with a nice view of the garden. There are two choices in the menu, vegetarian and regular. My wife opted for the vegetarian option and me for the regular fish/meat one. Both options were great but especially the veggie version was excellent.    We opted for the wine pairing by sommelier Cas. He explained all the choices and we had different wines as we had different menu’s, so lot’s to discuss what we enjoyed. We would have appreciated a bit more red wines and after the dinner Cas brought us a nice round red to finish of the evening.    The dinners started with two great amuses followed by 7 courses, I appreciated the pidgin a lot and my wife watermelon. What we missed was a small pre desert and a sweet desert, I understand the chef isn’t a real sweet tooth but some (me) are. So my tip for the menu is to put a bit more effort at the end, the chocolates with flavors of the menu didn’t do that for us."
d6864170,October 2020,50,Amazing from end to end,The service is so gentle and so considerate. Wine advices are very originals. And of course the diner was amazing. Every plate had several textures and colors and tastes. Thank you so much for this dîner!!!
d6864170,July 2020,50,Best dining experience in years,"Signature dishes with combinations of flavours and ingredients that are truly novel and surprising. Wonderful stylish and relaxing ambiance. The talented restaurant team lead by Sascha makes you live in the moment and enjoy the wonderful experience while everything is taken care of. To summarize, a fantastic restaurant at a fantastic location with a wonderful team that leaves you with a one of a kind experience that we will probably remember for years to come. Looking forward to revisit somewhere in the future."
d6864170,March 2020,50,Fine dining at it’s finest.,"Sidney, Sascha and the masterful team at Spectrum have created a truly once in a lifetime experience (though I hope to return soon!) We had the vegetable tasting menu and it was clear that the vegetarian menu was just as considered as the meat menu. Delicious surprises at every turn in a meal I will never forget. I’d say more but you should just go and go hungry!"
d6864170,February 2020,20,"The service is great, BUT...","The service is great, but the food is so “creative” that is really hard to swallow.  I love trying new stuff. In every city we go, we try to make some reservations in the best restaurants available and this was not a good experience. We asked for the tasting menu and just two of the ten plates where enjoyable. We’ve been in many, many places and this so sophisticated “pigeon meat/octopus chocolate” restaurant wasn’t for us. We really tried to enjoy it, but it was not easy."
d6864170,February 2020,50,"Creative dishes, lovely staff","A great place to try out food combinations you never thought about (like chocolate & truffles ).  Very risky flavor combinations , for most of the dishes it worked out for them.  There was no choice of bread, but the bread that they serve was on spot.  We ordered 2 cocktails, both were fantastic.  The servers stand out, engaging in a fun conversation with us, and even allowing us a peak to the kitchen!"
d6864170,December 2019,50,Beyond My Wildest Expectations,"After an entire year of research, and much consideration, I booked our hotel stay at the Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam and also booked dinner reservations at Spectrum for our final evening. I could not be happier with this choice!    Our dining experience at Spectrum was more incredible than I can even begin to describe. As we walked through our hotel lobby, someone immediately asked to escort us to Spectrum and took our coats. We had a lovely table in the corner and were surrounded by beautiful artwork.    Service was absolute perfection. The servers were professional, but not stuffy, warm, welcoming, helpful, and a true delight. Sascha went out of his way to make my special early milestone birthday celebration, the dining experience of a lifetime. We have had the opportunity to dine at many phenomenal restaurants around the world, but our experience at Spectrum tops them all. Executive Chef, Sidney Schutte, is truly brilliant and creates a feast for the senses with each course. Food was not just a work of art, but also a taste sensation.    We opted for the 11 course tasting menu, and this truly is the only way to do it. My husband and I are both pescetarians and I have a mushroom allergy, but the chef did a beautiful job constructing a meal that was out of this world.    I am very grateful that I read the TripAdvisor reviews on Spectrum because this convinced me to book our special dinner.    If you are ever near Amsterdam, you should go out of your way to dine at Spectrum. It will be an extraordinary experience that you will never forget. Thank you Patrycja, Sidney, and Sascha for making our trip to Amsterdam spectacular. Of all tours, museums, and activities we did in Amsterdam, dining at Spectrum was our favorite."
d696902,October 2022,50,Spectacular dinner and quite fun,"My wife and I dined at Ciel Blue on a weeknight recently. We chose one of the tasting menus with the premium wine pairings. We chose some of the options (caviar, cheese course) but decided to forgo at least one optional fish course. These were all excellent decisions. The room is beautiful, the view (complete with a rising full moon over the city) is incomparable, but, most importantly, the food is superb. First, the ingredients and flavors are excellent - creative, but not to the point of incoherence. Each course, and the courses as a whole, all make sense. The technique associated with each plate is wonderful to see. The best part, perhaps, was the service. We were attended by several pleasant and highly competent wait staff, and the sommelier walked us through each of the wine pairings (which were themselves superb). By the end of the evening, we realized that there was an ingredient sometimes missing in these kinds of restaurants, which was fun. It was fun to explore the dishes, fun to match them with the wines and fun to interact with the staff."
d696902,September 2022,50,It's an experience,"Just exquisite. It was our third time and Ciel Blue keeps surprising us. The food is surprising, and service is just perfect. Despite most tables have the same menu the personnel provides a tailor-made approach and makes you feel special."
d696902,September 2022,50,Amazing...worth every penny!,"What an incredible meal! We choose the Caviar Menu and WOW, did we certainly get ample portions of caviar! We also did the wine pairing...so worth it. The staff was so attentive, every detail was perfection. A special thank you to Francesco, the service manager, he helped to make my birthday celebration so memorable. Our sommelier, Noel, was beyond knowledgable, he made our evening so much fun. The entire evening will always bring a smile to our faces. First time in Amsterdam and first time at Ciel Bleu - we will definitely be back! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
d696902,September 2022,50,What a great michelin experience !!!,"Its always great to come back to the Ciel Bleu Restaurant. The excellent cooking and exceptional cuisine is definitely worth the gastronomic journey. Niccolo Sommelier and Julian Chef de Rang, our hosts, were brilliant especially towards our daughter who was celebrating her 21st birthday. Thank you so much guys for another extraordinary night at Amsterdam !!!"
d696902,July 2022,30,"Great service, nice view, unremarkable food.","The staff and service was top notch, but the food was a bit dissapointing. Only one or two dishes brought smiles to our faces, but honestly we had a much better food experience at De Kas the night before. We splurged for the Wagyu beef upgrade, but the meat was a bit to fatty for our taste (top grade Korean Hanu beef tastes better, with much nice texture). We felt like the restaurant has become complacent with its food? Definitely not worth the 700 euro we spent. We reccomend finding up and coming restaurants vs coming to a place like this."
d696902,July 2022,30,meh - interesting but for us not really worth the time,"Take this review with a grain of salt in that we tend to prefer great, non-stuffy one star restaurants than fancy two and three stars - unless they are really special and worth the time, pomp and circumstance. This one we felt was not. Everyone was very nice and the service was generally good, though perhaps not quite as attentive or refined as you'd typically expect in a restaurant where they go to the trouble of having everyone wear white gloves and stamping the restaurant's name into the tablecloths etc. The room felt a little dated, like 1980's trying to be fancy. The views are probably as good as it gets in Amsterdam, but actually staring over lots of houses and industrial facilities, it wasn't as striking as we had imagined (e.g., can't really see the water). Maybe it would be nicer later in the evening, but it doesnt get dark until really late in the summertime.... Wasn't really clear what they were going for on the food in terms of style/cuisine, but it was generally ok but not particularly notable for its flavors or quality of ingredients. e.g., Caviar dish supplement was ok but not particularly memorable, the supplement Wagyu dish was ok but for 60 euro extra again not particularly memorable. The days of just paying a lot more for a ""fancy"" supplement without really doing something special/memorable with those dishes are over.... With each dish came an indicative spice that was presented in a wooden receptacle on the table to illustrate a flavor that was highlighted in the dish. That was interesting but felt a bit kitchy, particularly when the food didn't really stand on its own. wine list was ok but there were very few options between the 150Euro range and the 500+ Euro range, so if you wanted a relatively nice bottle you had to really lean in (which we did and it was nice, but not mind blowing). Felt like the experience all dragged on a bit. Anyhow this restaurant is clearly striving for a standard that perhaps doesnt really exist in Amsterdam, which I suppose is not really known for its elegant food - we much preferred the meals we had at lower key places like Zoldering (which was amazing - Better, more interesting food without all the stuffiness). But obviously plenty of people feel differently based on the reviews..."
d696902,June 2022,50,Exquisite,"The dining experience was magnificent, from the exquisite food, service and atmosphere. A truly unforgettable experience"
d696902,June 2022,50,Great night,"Ciel Bleu is for many years one of the best restaurants in the Netherlands (best of Amsterdam). The most tables have a great few over Amsterdam from the 23th floor. The staff is kind and very professional and the food, all courses were amazing!! Keep up the good work Ciel Bleu!! See you soon!!"
d696902,May 2022,50,Top level experience,"Staying at the Okura Hotel there is a wide choice to dine. With 2 Michelin stars Ciel Blue at the top level of the hotel is the most exclusive to visit.  As might be expected all courses are of high standards, presented by a dedicated staff.  The courses show a wide variety of flavors, expressed by a small wooden cabinet that’s being filled during the various courses with a spice used in a course.  A small touch to give an extra emphasis on every course; Elegant, interesting and educational at the same time.    The presented wines absolutely match the quality of the food presented. With a listening ear to the guests the staff present excellent wines to match the taste and expectations you are having.    Overall an experience not easily to forget, overlooking the city while the sun sets slowly."
d696902,May 2022,50,"Exceptional restaurant, knowledgeable waiters and a beautiful atmosphere with a view","My second visit to Ciel Bleu. Beautiful elegant atmosphere, A nice view over Amsterdam from the window tables and a top attentive, discrete service. The wine card is a bible for wine enthusiasts and the food was a festive act for the mouth and eye and absolutely exceptional. I can totally recommend this restaurant which was a close to perfect experience."
d696902,April 2022,50,"Best meal, wine and view in Amsterdam.","An amazing evening that was capped off by an amazing staff and then oh yea there is the food. I do not even know how to say how wonderful this restaurant is. From the moment you get off the elevator on the 23rd floor you are greeted with amazing etiquette from manners, personality and just utter politeness. As we were taken to our table (by the way I believe there are only 12 tables) you cannot help but be “awwed” by the beautiful decor, flowers and glass sculptures on the tables (which by the way we learned are for sale). As soon as you are seated by the most amazing man that shares his experience and knowledge of the wines and champagnes. I could keep going but I will tell you the 5-course meal is actually 12 different foods and every single one was better than the last. But those entrees were mouth watering. The lamb melted in your mouth and the wagyu (which is a 60 euro upgrade) was so tasty.    We had an amazing evening (about 4 hours in total) and I thought We had only been there an hour. Stunning views, great staff and amazing food and wine - equals one of the best dinner out meal in my life. Thank you to all of you for making this amazing"
d696902,April 2022,50,Amazing dinner,Every course was remarkable. The spices really enhanced our meal and the wine selection from Chile went perfectly. Service was outstanding. Worth the splurge.
d696902,April 2022,50,Delicious and a real experience on the 23rd floor,"Wonderful experience and delicious courses. We had the 50 years of anniversary menu, perfectly matching wines served.  The view completed it all!"
d696902,April 2022,50,My favorite restaurant,"Finally after 2,5 years of covid lockdown and no traveling i did a midweek trip to Amsterdam.  I have been waiting for a new amazing evening at ciel bleu. Sence i found this beautiful restaurant over 10 years ago, i try to come back 3-4 times a year. Comeing back after 2,5 year made it even more amazing. The staff is great, food amazing and service impecable. Only good memories in the amazing place"
d696902,April 2022,50,Incredible evening overlooking Amsterdam at Ciel Bleu,"Such a thrill for the four of us to have such a stunning, engaging dining experience at Ciel Blue, a Michelin 2-star restaurant at the legendary Okura Hotel in Amsterdam. Such a pleasure to be pampered by an incredible team led by Sommelier, Nicolo. Every course was meticulously and wonderfully prepared and served. It was a grand 4 1/2 hour event/show with outstanding food and service. We cannot wait to return!"
d1014732,October 2022,50,Hidden gem!,"We visited Zaza's the last day of our Amsterdam trip and it had been an amazing food experience.    The restaurant itself is small, but we immediately loved the atmosphere here. A very nice waiter and Zaza herself welcomed us. Service is very quick and attentive.    The food choice is kept clear, you have different ones of starters, soups, main courses and desserts. There are Vegetarian options as well.    First we got some fresh bread with a tasty spread. As we enjoyed the amuse-bouche and our starters that much, we quickly decided to share a pasta dish as well, followed by fish dishes as main. What can I say... From the beginning to the end of our dinner all meals were fresh and tasteful, the combinations of the ingredients were outstanding. Big clap to the kitchen team!    If I come back one day to Amsterdam, Zaza's restaurant is a must! I can highly recommend it! Thanks to the team for this great - food - experience!    P.s.: Book your table in advance!"
d1014732,November 2022,50,Just perfect,"Perfect atmosphere for a dinner with quality food, pleasant music (boomers oriented), excellent and welcoming service."
d1014732,October 2022,50,Supper must try,"No comment about that restaurent , the food supper delicious the starters steak sea bream mulls and Chef special bites check the pictures u know what I mean , bytheway the waters the guy and lady are so professional and smiling always"
d1014732,October 2022,50,Best in the area,"The quality of the food is amazing. The service carefully but friendly led by owner Lisa is not only extremely nice but amazingly efficient. Creative and delicious, the changing menu is always outstanding. For the price, and this is very reasonable, this is hard to beat. And, we had dinner at a two star Michelin restaurant the night before. Zaza's is close on every count."
d1014732,October 2022,40,great place to have dinner,"I loved the atmosphere. Me and my wife had 2 excellent courses, cocktails deserve a special word as well. Nice staff."
d1014732,September 2022,40,Great restaurant and service,"We had a memorable visit just recently. Two very friendly servers efficiently served the entire dining room. Would like to have seen a more complete offering of alcoholic beverages, but the meal was quite good."
d1014732,September 2022,50,Fab-U-lous!,"Absolutely fantastic food and service. Could not fault anything. Wine,food,cocktails!! You have to go here and I don’t review that much."
d1014732,September 2022,50,One of the best fine dining experiences ever,"Goodness me, where to start. One of the best restaurant meals I’ve ever eaten, and all with some of the friendliest service ever. That pana cotta with chocolate mousse inside is to die for."
d1014732,July 2022,50,Superb birthday evening!,"Our third dinner at ZaZ’s was fantastic. The food, service and attention to detail was perfection. This is a must stop in Amsterdam."
d1014732,June 2022,50,Favourite in Dam,"This was our favourite restaurant during our visit to Amsterdam. Located in a lovely part of the city, the food brings together unique flavours and is very tasty. Perfect for couples as the dining area is quite intimate. Highly recommend, and pairs well with a post-dinner trip to Conncertgebouw!"
d1014732,July 2022,50,Lovely just lovey,The best meal I have had in a long while. Visiting for 2 days and chanced upon Zaza. Beautiful small intimate restaurant with amazing food and great service.
d1014732,July 2022,50,Excellent food and experience,"Excellent food and a very nice experience to have dinner here! Not too sophisticated, but definitely more pretentious than an average dinner at a regular restaurant. Very happy we went there!"
d1014732,June 2022,50,Amazing,"Not only was the food absolutely delicious, but also the staff was wonderful! We came with our daughter and they went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. We were a bit in a rush and they responded very fast to each of our needs. Definitely worth a visit!"
d1014732,June 2022,50,Delicious meal in a hip yet quaint setting.,"From the service to the food quality to the vibe, Zaza’s gets a 10/10. Even the cocktails and the wine list was superb. It feels like a home cooked meal but Michelin style. Definitely recommended!"
d1014732,June 2022,50,Delicious food !! Home made,Really good food. Every dish was delicious and special. Definitely recommend this place. Service was also very good and overall great place
d697058,October 2022,40,Pleasant experience and tasty food,"I almost canceled my reservation after reading the review titled ""seriously disappointed"". I'm glad I did not. This was not fine dining, nor did I expect it to be, and that said, it was a nice night out. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the food was quite good (I had the sultan menu with the beef) and my friend had the vegan option, and we both liked our food and ate every bit. If I had to point out a negative, it nay have been the dessert. Advice: they tell you to eat this little bean they give you with dessert, to cleanse your palat before eating the rest of the dessert. The bean tasted terrible. We laughed about this! My lemon Panna cotta was a bit overcooked but my friend's cinnamon/cardamom cake was quite good."
d697058,October 2022,50,A restaurant with imagination,"Each time I have visited Amsterdam, dining at the Blue Pepper has been a highlight. The food is always imaginative, fresh, attractive and delicious in surprising ways. Portions are right-sized so that one can taste many creations without overeating."
d697058,October 2022,50,Indodesian food and wine pairing in Amsterdam,"I had the full menu with wine pairing and everything was very, very good. My favorite dishes were the goose and the water buffalo. The wines complemented the food well.The service was also excellent."
d697058,September 2022,10,Seriously Disappointed,"Our visit to this restaurant spoiled a 3 day visit to Amsterdam. We only had 2 evenings to enjoy and a friend who had dined here, evidently now some years ago , recommended the restaurant and so we allocated precious time and serious money in to visiting here. What a disgrace …. our tiny mackerel starter and seafood soup were ‘nice’ enough but the next 2 larger courses involving a paper bowl with quinoa ( I think) and a beef rendang stew were bland in fact nearly tasteless, apart from the rice that didn’t taste that nice. Our meal concluded with a slice of lemon meringue cake that had a soggy top and was a bit curled at the edges as it had been left uncovered for a while and was so average.  What on earth is going on here ….. ? Staff were nice enough but I agree that they looked like they’d just pulled on some clothes for work and the restaurant itself is actually’mucky’ with candle wax splatters on dusty shelves next to the un table clothed chipped painted tables. Our cutlery was from a bargain shop .  Extortionate prices for the food that was served to us, we really resented handing over 57 Euros per person for what we received and were only grateful we didn’t select the 75 Euro option which was I think was just 2 extra courses of something presumably not up to scratch either. If we hadn’t been with friends creating memories I would have challenged the restaurant manager as felt so strongly overcharged and when money is precious too and fine dining is such a special treat I am writing this as it unfair to spoil people’s experiences.  We went away trying to make light of it and laugh it off but please can the level of food and dining experience be elevated immediately or alternatively drop your prices significantly to reflect the quality of food and diner expectations."
d697058,August 2022,50,Group canal dinner cruise,Abu and team were amazing. I was planning a 40 person dinner canal cruise- and didn’t want the standard offerings. Abu worked with me on the menu options to provide a unique experience. I highly recommend this restaurant or canal cruise!
d697058,June 2022,50,Thrilling Surprise,"Don't come here for traditional rice tables -- there are other places in Amsterdam for that. Do come here for an utterly unique, thrilling, surprising dance party for your taste buds. Pleasant and accommodating staff (I don't eat seafood, and they were happy to help shift the menu). Perhaps my best meal in Amsterdam after many culinary visits."
d697058,June 2022,40,Lovely food.,"Came here on our last day in Amsterdam. It was a lovely experience, starting from the service to the food.    The food was delicious and well presented. My husband had the Sultan Tinder Menu and I had the Vegan option instead.    The last part of the evening started to be a bit boring and slow as we waited too long for the dessert to arrive. For this reason we decided to skip the dessert (that was part of the menu) to leave. The owner was very kind and apologized for the delay and he didn’t make us pay for the dessert.    We left happy for the experience after all.    Lovely place, to try.    General value: 8/10  Food value: 8.5/10"
d697058,May 2022,50,Delicious Indonesian food in a warm welcoming environment,"The concierge at the Marriott highly recommended this restaurant and it did not disappoint. We ordered the multi course meal. Everything was delicious and different than what we have eaten in the US. The staff was friendly, flexible with requests and helpful in explaining the courses. We are at another Indonesian restaurant later in the week and The Blue Pepper was by far the better meal and experience.  The restaurant is small so make reservations and then enjoy your evening meal."
d697058,April 2022,50,Still going strong!,"I was really worried that this place would not live up to the hype, or that it had gotten tired, but I was so pleased to find out I did not need to be concerned! Every dish was wonderful! Inventive yet evocative of traditional Indonesian food. We took our parents, who had never had Indonesian food and do not particularly like Thai or Indian food, and they LOVED it, as did we. And the service was warm, friendly, and prompt. Just a pleasurable experience all around!"
d697058,April 2022,50,Utterly Amazing,"My wife and I have been fortunate enough to travel and experience many parts of the world and try many different restaurants. So when I say this was one of our top two restaurant meals ever - which it was - I don’t say that lightly. We had the Rijsttafel experience last night at Blue Pepper and it was nothing short of amazing. First, the vibe was super-chill, which is so nice after being in a busy city all day. The amberjack tartar was perfectly spiced, the seafood stew was silky and lemony in the best possible way. To this moment, I can’t get over the watermelon course. I’m not kidding. If you had told me it was a tuna steak, I would have believed you. The goose, the quinoa, the shrimp, the water buffalo, the dessert…I could go on and on. My compliments and thanks to the chef and owner who was 100% hands-on the entire experience. It’s a dinner we will never forget."
d697058,April 2022,20,Pretends to be a fine dining restaurant but it really isn't,"I had a great experience at the Blue Pepper a few years ago and decided to return. Sadly, this restaurant is a shadow of its former self. I guess there has been a change of owner?    First impressions were already ominous. The waiter who greeted me was wearing a smart shirt paired with a Nike tracksuit bottom. Not that I particularly care (I'm here for the food), but come on. You are giving off the vibe ""My boss told me to dress smart but I can't be bothered to put in any effort"".    The food itself I would describe as an equally half-hearted attempt at gourmet Indonesian cuisine. Pretentious presentation aside, it was perfectly edible but conventional and rather bland. Some of it seemed microwaved. Nothing you couldn't find for half the price at any low end Indonesian restaurant.    The kids' meal was a joke. I was promised chicken sate with fried rice. Instead I got served the same boiled rice that comes with all the main courses, a huge dollop of fries with ketchup and mayonnaise, and one single tiny chicken skewer. Zero vegetables. They charged 20 Euros for this meal. Even 10 Euros would have been a rip off.    I would have given 3 stars for the food and service, but will subtract one star because they are shamelessly charging gourmet prices for sub-gourmet food."
d697058,November 2021,50,Amazing authentic Indonesian food,Great place for authentic Indonesian cuisine. Great vegan options. Highly recommended! If you want authentic Indonesian food in Amsterdam this place is a must try. It's the perfect location also for a date. The place also looks beautiful and has a warm atmosphere.
d697058,November 2021,30,"Food was edible, prices weren't","Overall, food was decent and edible. Stopped here because it was close to my hotel and I didn't want to walk too far. Customer Service was great, and love that they followed COVID protocols. The fresh fish and seafood soup, with lemongrass and tangy citrus was hot and flavorful. I enjoyed this dish. The spicy, classic slow-cooked Indonesian beef stew didn't wow me, and the rice side dish was overcooked and mushy. Prices were a bit steep too."
d697058,September 2021,50,The place to go !,"My second visit to this restaurant, two years after the first time. Very tasty food, original menu, nice atmosphere, professional service with a smile, great advice on the choice of dishes. I recommend the place to anyone going to Amsterdam. The place is easy to find near Leidesplein."
d697058,August 2021,50,My favorite Indonesian Restaurant in Amsterdam,"I love Blue Pepper's refined cuisine. I really enjoy Indonesian food in general, and I love Blue Pepper especially. Lots of Rijs Tafel restaurants emphasize quantity and number of dishes instead of quality. Here is where Blue Pepper excels. The food is served in five or six different courses instead of all at once and I appreciate that. The quantities are ample and the quality of the food is exceptional."

d697009,August 2022,50,Amazing night with Amazing Food & Service,"I have traveled to Japan many times, but I have never visited a place outside of Japan that captures the kitchen like culture of Japan as well as Sazanka. Wagyu - as mind blowing, as the first time I have tasted it in Kobe. The staff (Tsuzuki, Mitsumi, Christina) were amazing and made tonight a reason to book another trip to Japan. Culinaire holiday in Amsterdam."
d697009,August 2022,50,Wonderful,"Amazing experience! Want to say special thanks for the best steak I've ever eaten to chef Takuma, and also for the delightful service to Mitsumi and Kristina. We enjoyed our dinner here!"
d697009,August 2022,50,Above & Beyond! We will be back!,"Our family had such a wonderful evening here.    Not all fine-dining restaurants respond well to young children, but here all staff was super nice to our two daughters of 4 and 6 years old, and splitting one menu among them was no problem. Our waitress Mitsumi even waited for our daughter at the bathroom to bring her back to the table to make sure she didn't get lost!    The food was superb -- I still dream of the salt crusted seabream that our chef Takuma prepared in front of us. The kids loved how he set the beef on fire :)    Good sommeliers are hard to find these days, but Menno really knows his sake and wines. He immediately sensed that we are into wine, so he took all the time to give us tailor-made advice and let us taste some extraordinary wines.    Finally, Christina our head-waitress, thank you so much for making this an unforgettable experience! She was continuously on top of everything and made sure all went smooth.    We've seen lately that a lot of restaurants (even the supposedly top ones) are cutting corners after covid and due to staff shortage, but not here at Sazanka. Just old-fashioned good service and food with all bells and whistles. We can't wait to go back!"
d697009,July 2022,50,"Delicious Dinner, Great hospitality",Always great experience having dinner here. Enjoy the seasonal summer menu with Wagyu from Saka prefecture.    Services from Akiko and Kota san is second-to-none. ご馳走様でした

d697009,June 2022,50,"What a vist! Delicious, unforgettable and unpretentious","Well, what is there to say only - fabulous. We were a family group of six celebrating something special. From the moment we walked in, we were treated like honoured guests but also with a warm familiarity. We were served by Akiko, Takuma, Meno and Christina, who were so lovely, attentive and kind.  And then came the food - Takuma was our chef. He patiently and kindly put up with all our questions and chatted with us. We had the seasonal menu, which was, of course, the standard that you would expect cooked at your table with impeccable presentation. Simply delicious! Menno guided us through the wine and saki menu with fun and incredible knowledge. Aniko and Christina appeared unobtrusively to explain the dishes and attend to requests. I can only thank each of the team for making our evening so memorable and special."
d697009,June 2022,50,"Excellent service, food and wine.","Thank you for a really lovely evening with both Hiroto and Christina being excellent and wonderful. The food, wine and service was excellent. Thanks also to the brilliant sommelier whose name I missed. Thank you all. Top stuff"
d1955652,August 2022,50,Best herring sandwich ever!,"Went there with my friends to try the traditional herring sandwich. The owner was very kind and gentle and needless to say we got extremely enthusiastic about the herring sandwich - it is delicious! I understand that it may not be for everyone, but if you enjoy strong flavours I totally recommend it! We got ours served in a nice hot dog bun topped with pickles and white onions. It was a true revelation! We also enjoyed some bits of fried cod which were extremely tender and flavourful. If you happen to come to Amsterdam and want to try one of its most typical dishes, this is the place to go!"
d1955652,August 2022,50,HERRING HEAVEN,Wonderful little backstreet cafe Worth all the hype Had 2 herring sandwiches Astonishing Best herring ever Washed down with Amstel Ridiculous value for money It really doesn’t get any better
d1955652,July 2022,50,"Excellent, cheap, good service, friendly, quick. Tasty food. Speak number of languages including Russian.","Excellent, cheap, good service, friendly, quick. Tasty food. Excellent place for a quick bite near the Dam square. Speak number of languages including Russian."
d1955652,May 2022,50,Must visit,"Very tasty herring! The staff is friendly and polite! Although, make sure you have cash, they don't accept cards. The place itself is quite small, most likely you will have to finish your herring in the streets nearby."
d1955652,May 2022,50,Authentic and excellent,"It is simple, but the quality is excellent. Try not only the Matjes, the smoked eel is outstanding. You can bring in a glass of Genever from the bar across the street"
d1955652,January 2020,40,Good food,"Primarily a takeout with a couple of tables serving very good fresh herring and an assortment of other seafood such as smoked eel,smoked salmon,several pickled herring,and four or five fried fish such as cod. Also an assortment of herring and seafood salads. Enjoyed the fresh herring,smoked eel,pickled herring and their beet smoked salmon and herring salad on more then one occasion over the years."
d1955652,September 2020,50,The best herring in Amsterdam.,The best herring in Amsterdam. The staff is very kind and the food is delicious. I suggest the classic herring with a good Dutch bier
d1955652,August 2019,50,Fresh Herring Sandwich,"Come here for the fresh herring sandwich. This is our 3rd time back after visiting twice in 2014. Same cheerful owner, same delicious fresh herring sandwich. Will return if we visit Amsterdam again."

d1955652,March 2019,50,The best sandwich spot with the nicest owner!,"I highly recommend a trip to this amazing little shop/cafe; get chatting to the owner about choices, he's highly knowledgeable and full of good local facts! Make sure you try something local; I had the Mackrel sandwich which was scrummy."
d1955652,February 2020,50,Super tasty,"If you're visiting Amsterdam and interested in affordable and delicious local food, this is the place to be. Excellent service and freshly cooked food. More than one reason to return!"
d1955652,December 2019,50,Simple yet delicious,"It can be so simple. Herring, pickle, baguette, little bit of side vegetables. Nothing better to settle your stomach after a night out. This was a great place to do that for us. The food was delicious."
d1955652,January 2020,50,Super fresh and super cheap,"Make sure to try their traditional Dutch herring. The freshest herring I’ve ever tasted, and I come from Lithuania - country of herring experts."
d1955652,December 2019,30,Average quality,"Average quality, heating the fried fish in the microwave.. didn't try the hearing .. the place is to small and the street not kids friendly"
d1955652,November 2019,10,Not a fish restaurant!,"Mostly raw herring in different forms, very limited options, but we tried the fried fish sandwich and it is little bits of deep-fried oily fish on hard white bread with pickles. Nothing to be excited about."
d10275170,September 2022,50,Amazing! Thank you ❤,That's my second visit at this lovely place and I am not disappointed again! Amazing burgers with lot of choices and wonderful taste! Stuff is friendly and professional at the same time. This place is worth to be ❤ Thank you!
d10275170,July 2022,50,Amazing food. A must visit,"We searched this place on trip advisor. Took two teams to get there and boy was it worth it! Amazing burgers!!!! Tiberius our waiter was very helpful with the menu. Texas burger, Hottie Burger and Nachos with chilli can’t go wrong."
d10275170,July 2022,50,Beautiful day,Perfect burger on a perfect day in Amsterdam. We came in early and had a great lunch while enjoying the backyard and good beer.
d10275170,July 2022,50,Lovely burgers,"Tried the burgers it to be honest one the top 5 restaurants for burgers in Ams for me, tasty and juicy burgers well cocked and it’s a cozy place. Recommended if you’re around this area ♥️👌🏼"
d10275170,July 2022,50,Great atmosphere and staff,"Visited this place with my team during the floorball tournament in Amsterdam. Very tasty burgers with very friendly staff. As a matter of fact one was from our neighboring country - Lithuania, which made the experience even more flattering 🤩😎"
d10275170,July 2022,50,Fantastic Burger in Amsterdam,"While exploring the area of our B&B, we found this gem of a place. You knew something was good by how many of the tables had ""Reserved"" signs on them. Best burger (BBQ) I've had anywhere and puts ""Red Robin"" to shame."
d10275170,July 2022,40,Amazing veggie burger and friendly staff,"Got off to a tough start. Came there with my friends, we had booked a table but no server came up to us in a long time so we sat down on our down. Then they asked us to change table for a bigger group of people, which was fine but it was before they even greeted us or gave us menus. Just a small, strange first impression, service wise. They all proved me wrong after that though, very friendly and caring. Food was amazing. I don't know what it was, it's almost as if Amsterdam put something special in their food - tasted great. Took their veggie burger which was insane, very realistic grilled meat patty feeling even though it was vegan. Fries very heavenly. This is a fantastic burger place with a chill vibe. Nothing fancy but still cozy! Good music too :)"
d10275170,May 2022,50,Don't miss this place,Brilliant burgers. Great service. Superb atmosphere. It is well run and very friendly. Don't miss this place. I recommend.
d10275170,May 2022,50,Best Burgers!,"Had the best high quality burger ever! Also very friendly service who helped us, to order only as much food as we might achieve."
d10275170,April 2022,40,Very delicious and very good quality,Delicious Burgers for good prices! The burgers are really big and have a good quality. Also the service is very friendly. The only thing what is a little bit „negative“ is that it was very loud and cold in there.
d10275170,March 2022,50,Tasty burgers!,"This is a nice burger restaurant. The atmosphere is pleasant and the staff is both efficient and friendly. We loved our burgers: cheese burger and bacon burger. We took two portions of fries: classic and the sweet potatoes and this was almost too much! Sweet potatoes fries were the best. Good selection of beers too. We paid 44€ for two burgers, two portions of fries and two beers. You won't leave hungry. Enjoy!"
d10275170,April 2022,50,Amazing ❤️,"Love this place!! The food is very good, the service is so helpful and sweet. The restaurant is located on a very good place. Thank you so much for everything ❤"
d10275170,March 2022,50,Amazing burgers with fresh ingredients,"I strongly recommend Happy Bull if you're ever craving for some good burgers. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very cosy, owner are lovely and the food is outstanding. I know where I'll be eating next time I go to Amsterdam"
d10275170,March 2022,50,Fantastic burgers with so much to choose from!,Fabulous food and great service!! The burgers were delicious and cooked perfectly. The menu is great for everyone! I can’t recommend this place enough for a great dinner.
d10275170,March 2022,10,Disappointing,"We drove all the way from the center of Amsterdam for this restaurant and it is really scammed us.  The food is not good and everything was burned.  We reserved a table before we came and they put us in the back of the restaurant in the darkest place they found.  It looks like the deliveries was top priority and not us waiting for the food for about 45 minutes.  Really shame we drove 25 minutes for this restaurant only because somehow it is highly recommended and it is the worst.  People look out, it's scam."
d1014753,September 2022,50,Cozy breakfast place,We had a cozy & very delicious breakfast here on our last day in Amsterdam. Everything was very tasty & intimate. The lady who attended our table was very attentive as well. Recommended 👍
d1014753,August 2022,50,A very nice place for a quick lunch,"This place is very easy to miss, as it’s located on a small and quiet street between to busy streets. The staff is very friendly and the food was excellent. I would recommend making a reservation."
d1014753,July 2022,50,High tea delight,"A hidden gem in one of the more quiet side streets of the buzzling Kalverstraat. The location was beautiful, intimate and cozy. We decided to go for savory high tea version. You could choose a pot of tea for two (really enjoyed Les Invités). We had a soup and a variation of different sandwiches and a quiche (which was eggy, somewhat fluffy - just divine). It was a rollercoaster ride of different flavors. The staff was warm and welcoming. You won’t be disappointed."
d1014753,June 2022,50,Great farm fresh food,"Small, intimate dining experience with incredible farm fresh food options. Amazing desserts. The High tea service is very good. Will be going back"
d1014753,June 2022,50,Amazing,"Amazing place, so Cosy , good service and delicious food. The deco was so pretty. The staff/owner so friendly and had the best breakfast"
d1014753,June 2022,50,Lovely breakfast spot🫶,Just perfect breakfast in lovely surroundings and the staff was so friendly - can only recommend this place🌟 Consider to reserve a table as it is a small place and very popular 😊
d1014753,May 2022,50,Excellent,"A lovely little brunch restaurant tucked away in a side street, 5 minutes walk from Dam Square. The ambiance is charming, service extremely friendly and the food is excellent. Booking a table is recommended as it's a small place and almost always busy."
d1014753,March 2022,40,If it's the food that matters,The neighbourhood is nothing special and the restaurant itself overlooks a dusty alley but the food was excellent and the staff very friendly. Reservations are necessary on the weekends.
d1014753,December 2021,50,Very Nice Breakfast,"The breakfast was very tasty! Kirsten and Willem-Jan are so welcomed! Good healthy food, good location, Good address for a nice moment ;)"
d1014753,October 2021,50,Hidden surprise,We stumbled across this place by accident when we turned down a tiny street while exploring Amsterdam. I took notice to a couple enjoying tea from a lovely tea service bt the window and had to take a look. Out of curiosity we decided to try it. There happened to be a table outside and even though they were fully booked we were lucky enough to get a spot. We were beyond surprised. The food was great (their soup made from veggies out of their own garden was amazing) the service was wonderful. We will definitely be going back.
d1014753,September 2021,50,The best eggs I have ever,The best eggs I have ever tried In my life and the staff was really polite and joyfull. It is a must in this town!
d1014753,September 2021,50,I'll be a regular now,"Definitely I will frequent this place. Tasteful recipes, smiley faces, warm atmosphere. Loved it. Unsurprising it got this many positive reviews."
d1014753,June 2021,50,Delicate tasty dishes,"Eventho the menu writes clearly what every dish is, it was hard to imagine what to eat or how the flavors would be combined. The dishes are delicate dishes, unique and the one with PEAS AND PARMSANE cheese was delicious, super tasty and HEALTHY. The lettuce even was nicely seasoned and crunchy. Would come here again!"
d1014753,June 2021,50,"Great place, better reserve !","There are not so many tables and it is better to reserve, if you are lucky and could enjoy their breakfast, you can only applause the choice of fresh jam, tasty toast, choice of tea. French Breakfast, eggs Bénédictin , you name it they have it. Super friendly personnel, fast service.  Will come back !"
d1014753,September 2020,50,Wonderful food,"Amazing good, healthy and also delicious food. The ingredients are all fresh and grown in their own garden! You can definitely taste this in the dishes"
d7695005,October 2022,50,Absolut fantastic experience!,"First to be mentioned: the host! A good laugher right from the beginning, a very best service during the dinner and an absolute fantastic evening for sure. All dishes cooked to perfection. The yellow root beet dish was outstanding. The combination of pumpkin and tandoori sauce – marvelous. The taste and texture of the ravioli course was amazing and finally: the coq o vein: very nice and with a lovely combination of chicken liver. For the final course: a ginger beer ice-cream: outstanding. There was absolutely nothing to complain about and we had a very good time at a great place with great staff and welcoming hosts. We strongly recommend to have a visit for sure."
d7695005,August 2022,50,Totally worth visiting!,"Excellent food. It's woth visiting at least once, despite the prices! It's a unique experience and service is on another level!"
d7695005,October 2022,50,"Great food, friendly and unpretentious service",It was perfect from start to finish. The pairing of wine with the food was perfect too. We had the 6 course tasting menu. Well worth it.
d7695005,August 2022,50,Absolutely Fantastic Cuisine!,"This restaurant appears very understated. We took the six course option, and even though the portions were small, we left comfortably full! We understand why this is a Michelin-rated feast."
d7695005,August 2022,50,Wonderful restaurant - we got engaged at the end of the meal!,"This lovely little restaurant had the perfect atmosphere, with only a handful of tables seated around us. We felt well attended, with drinks and food flowing. We had the chef's surprise 6 course menu and added a cheeseboard. Bread and two canape-like dishes were also brought out on-top of the 6 courses (so 8 plates in total). I have not had another dining experience like it. The food tasted and looked incredible and each dish complimented the next. We hope to come back in several years to celebrate our anniversary."
d7695005,August 2022,50,Delicious and reasonably-priced haute cuisine…,"It’s a great place. Relatively small and not bang in the centre. It’s the food that you come for though. Six courses plus a few extra amouses and petit fours. What I was particularly happy about is that often with these tasting menus you get terribly excited after a few starters then the main courses disappoint. Not the case here. The chef keeps his powder dry early on and the menu builds to some really delicious mains. I was here with my family for my sons birthday and we were well looked after and everyone thoroughly enjoyed the food and the evening as a whole. The bill when it came was very reasonable and I thought it represented excellent value for money for the quality of cuisine (you’ll spend double at some restaurants in the centre). Would definitely recommend. We will return. I am sure it’s Michelin star is just round the corner (when presumably they’ll put their prices up, so get in there while you can!)"
d7695005,August 2022,50,Excellent meal and experience,"We went for the 5 course tasting menu and wine by the glass to match the courses which was great. Food was amazing. Atmosphere was relaxed and not stuffy, staff were friendly. It was for a special birthday and certainly fitted the bill!"
d7695005,August 2022,50,Amazing food!,Absolutely loved this restaurant! The chef was so imaginative with the food and everything was delicious! The service was also lovely so only positive things to say
d7695005,July 2022,50,Superb set menu - relax and enjoy your evening,We went for the 6 course tasting menu and it was amazing. Service was attentive but discreet. We sat near to the kitchen so we could see the attention to detail from the chefs. We went for the wine by the glass to match the courses and the variety of wine was fantastic too. So ultimately a wide variety of food having gone for the meat and fish dishes - every mouthful was really tasty.
d7695005,July 2022,50,Amazing food and great matching wine,"this restaurant was in the vicinity of where we stayed in Amsterdam. It was recommended in our guide book and received rave reviews on Tripadvisor. Congratulations to my guidebook (lonely planet) and Tripadviser, this restaurant is exceptional. The small front of house team managed a full restaurant, switching easily between multiple languages. The kitchen team produced food of a high standard. My wife went vegetarian. I had meat and fish. None of the 10 dishes disappointed. Even better, the matching wines were perfect accompaniments for the food.  A word of warning: there isn't a menu; the food presented reflects what is in season and available. The choice will be the number of courses you choose (4-6), but don't let that put you off, they will respect any food allergies preferences and create a lovely memory for you."
d7695005,July 2022,50,Excellent meal,We had the 6-course surprise meal last night and it was a great meal. Very nuanced tastes with every plate. The desert was amazing as well. We all felt that the service was fantastic it was a fun evening and the food was a real treat.
d7695005,June 2022,40,Fantastic food with relaxing atmosphere,"Diner was great, even with a very difficult eater. The staff and chef did their utmost best to give us fantastic food. The atmosphere is relaxed and easy going making it an visit to remember."
d7695005,June 2022,50,Lovely restaurant!,"We had a lovely 4 course menu. Tastes were inventive and creative. Nice staff, no long waits. Nice atmosphere. We had a very good experience. Will come back!"
d7695005,June 2022,50,take your taste buds for a tour,"We took our taste buds for a 5 course adventure and loved every course! Flavours were surprising, yet balanced. Friendly and considerate staff. Worth visiting this hidden gem at the end of Overtoom."
d7695005,June 2022,50,Great Experience and Value,"Great and imaginative food expertly prepared and served. From the amuse bouches, through 6 courses, a cheese plate and wine pairings, everything was amazing. Would happily return any time. Adam is also great value. Inexpensive for the quality of the experience."
d3893242,June 2022,50,Absolutely loved this place,"Friendly folks, great beer, cozy, best spot I went to in Amsterdam. Try the house IPA. If you like drinking somewhere relaxed and unpretentious the Golem is perfect."
d3893242,May 2022,50,Still a favourite place,"Small bar near to Spui which has a distinctive, very lived-in interior and a regular, garrulous& friendly crowd."
d3893242,April 2022,50,Little bit of heaven on earth!,Wonderful friendly service Brilliant atmosphere Unbelievable selection of draft and bottled beers Definitely be back here!
d3893242,March 2022,50,Here Every Night,In Amsterdam for three nights and visited here on a recommendation. Came all three nights we were in Amsterdam. Wonderful place. Small place but great atmosphere. Tremendous selection of beers from Belgium and Nederlands.......Brown cafe ambience was perfect. Bar staff a bit unhelpful.
d3893242,November 2021,50,Love it!,"Biercafe Gollem is great! Always lively with a great atmosphere, large selection of beers and nice bites to eat! We've been here quite a few times now and always enjoyed it!"
d3893242,March 2020,50,"Gollum, the one and only","I’ve been enjoying beer and conversation at Gollum for many years. It is the Perfect beer cafe. Brown cafe ambience that cannot be faked, only accumulated over decades....small and intimate, gezellig in every respect. And an astounding beer selection. Beyond belief, given the minuscule size of the bar...I generally go with the current seasonal or featured draft, ably assisted by the erudite and friendly barkeeper. This is a perfect place for the solo traveler to take a beer break and meet fascinating people from all over the world. You can’t get more Amsterdam than this place. And, it is mere steps from Spui, my favorite square.  The best thing? I just saw it on the menu board (which covers the entire wall). Just down in the corner, after the hundreds of beers, is the small notation: “yes, we have no biterballen”. Long may they run. And drink."
d3893242,March 2020,50,Great beers; lovely atmosphere.,Great beers and a lovely atmosphere in there. The barman was friendly and helpful. Sometimes it is hard to find a seat as it can be quite busy.
d3893242,February 2020,50,It must have been like this in the sixtees!,"Biercafe Gollem is hidden in one of the alleys of a street that borders the renown 9 little streets of Amsterdam.    Old interior and walls filled with wooden plaques with beer names add to a dreamy atmosphere of this two- level rather small but warm place. It is a beer pub, and the beer selection is great, combined with generous cheese boards and with music coming from the background that one would wish to be slightly louder at times. It is a great place to spend an hour or two and wonder how it must have felt being in Amsterdam in the summer (or winter :)) of 1969; definitely a place that deserves a second (and more) visit;"
d3893242,February 2020,50,Just brilliant,"Some kind of beer radar steered my wife to the alleyway this bar is on. Several hours later, having sampled a range of bottled and draft beers (loved the Gollem Precious IPA especially) conversed with several somewhat inebriated drinkers from Holland and the world, chilled out and watched the world going by, we sadly had to leave. Just a wonderful place to spend time."
d3893242,February 2020,40,Brilliant beer,"Biercafe Gollem is a no frills pub. It serves a large variety of excellent beers. A bit expensive but worth it, 5 Euros of a 1/4 litre of 10% proof craft beer. Good atmosphere."
d3893242,February 2020,50,Cracking bar with cracking beers (and cheese),"My second visit to Biercafe Gollem having stumbled across it on a previous visit to Amsterdam. Amazing array of beers both on tap and bottled. Knowledgeable bar staff, correct glass for each beer and good music.    Can highly recommend Satan Gold and don't forget the cheese platter. A match made in heaven. Will visit if i come to Amsterdam again"
d3893242,January 2020,50,Extensive beer collection,Extensive beer collection and great cheese board. Stopped in for a drink. It was a dark cozy space with good service. Enjoyed our large snack and a few beers. Could have stayed the afternoon!
d3893242,December 2019,50,A favourite place,"Always worth a visit. Warm, welcoming with a very good tap list plus hundreds in bottles. Open from 16.00 til late. Well-recommended."
d3893242,November 2019,50,Favourite Bar,Probably my favourite bar anywhere in the world. Amazing selection of beers in a very cosy and friendly setting.
d3893242,October 2019,50,"Small, but mighty!","Great beer place! Very small, but an abundant selection of beers. I visit it on every Amsterdam trip!"
d1408533,October 2022,30,My personal daalder experience,"First fine dining experience in Amsterdam and it was as average as could be. For $250 usd (tasting menu, $65 caviar add on *don’t recommend* ,no alcohol) & 1 Michelin star I would have expected some risks taken. Amuse bouche was a really playful way to start the meal. Sushi meringue was fun, kombucha was tasty, savory madeleine with smoked fish was delicious, and beetroot cone was as well. After that the meal was monotone & repetitive with the constant use of foams. Langoustine with beurre noisette foam, sole meunière with foam , Lobster with leek foam, and truffle foam with a greasy pomme purée . If you are going to serve sole meunière at a caliber of this place I would expect it to be the best sole meunière I’ve ever had not a bland one. Maybe an off night with all the good reviews that are there but I personally wouldn’t go back for that price point."
d1408533,October 2022,50,A wonderful dining experience,Chef Dennis gave us a great culinary experience.  The staff was very friendly and helpful explain the dishes.  Thomas was extremely helpful with the wine suggestions.  All bottles that are for sale can be served by the glass.  María one of the server's made our dinner extra special.
d1408533,September 2022,50,Excellent,"If you are looking for a classic gourmet temple, move on. The Daalder gives you 150 beats per minute and modern design. The tables are spacious. The staff is very welcoming, and everyone is taking care of the guests. We had in total at least seven people attending.  The food was speedily delivered and tasted formidable. Our glasses were never empty during the meal. The dishes were explained and if necessary, the waiters shared some personal recommendations.  The tasting experience was outstanding. The presentations and arrangements of the different dishes was excellent.  A perfect meal for a special celebration."
d1408533,July 2022,50,My all-time personal favorite,"By far, the best dining experience of my 65 year-long life. Every chorus was fantastic. Seeing the culinary team in action only enhance the dining experience. If you are in Amsterdam, this is the one restaurant you must see."
d1408533,June 2022,50,Looked after a solo traveller,As a solo traveller I am sometimes cautious about visiting ‘posh’ restaurants- but Daalder looked after me from start to finish. I don’t frequent Michelin starred restaurants (this is only my 3rd - and will accept that 1 of those was the Singapore hawker) but this is the best I’ve tried so far. I was amazed at the variety of changing tastes and food quality. Highly worth a visit. My usual food is McDonald’s but I was happy to pay the Daalder price for the service and food I received.
d1408533,May 2022,50,The Epitome of Gezelligheid,"Daalder is first and foremost a gracious and yet unfussy example of kind and welcoming hospitality. Each and every member of staff walks, talks and works with an upbeat tempo that clearly demonstrates their enthusiasm for delivering a top notch dining experience. The artistic expression evident in the decor, the food and the ambience all seem to stem from a very positive and affirming root. What grows from that root is a space clearly designed to facilitate the art of cuisine, the art of conversation and most of all: the art of gezelligheid.    We chose the Daalder Experience tasting menu with the sommelier’s exclusives wine paring. Brilliant. We added the wagyu course as well. Each exquisitely prepared plate was delivered with great enthusiasm - with head chef Dennis Huwaë himself even delivering a few. Staff seemed to love working with each other, love the cuisine they served and love providing a great experience for the guests.    The brilliant hospitality is matched by a vibrant, pulsing energy that animates the proceedings while still invoking a relaxed, luxuriously contemplative pace of dining. We concluded our repast sated and yet not sedated, with a firm desire to return."
d1408533,February 2022,20,Average and arrogant,"Our journey in this one star Michelin restaurant started with the following conversation: Guest ""Do you have portwine?"" Waitress: ""I have to ask"". The waitress comes back after 5 minutes: ""yes we do have portwine."" Guest: ""what kind of portwine do you have?"" Waitress: ""a good one"". Guest: well i ean: is there only one portwine or are there different kinds?"" Waitress: ""i have to ask"".    Well if this the quality of the staff you know its going to be a tough night. Conclusion: Food very average, wine good but glasses only half full en prices sky high, staff horrible."
d1408533,March 2022,10,"What a terrible place to go, never again!","What a terrible place. The waiters look annoyed all the time and the food was terrible. Never again. Especially the price to food comparison, my god."
d1408533,February 2022,50,Fabulous Valentine's Day Menu,"It started at the front of house and ended with the waitress who guided us to the exit at the end - impeccable, friendly, amazing service. Every person we came across was incredibly helpful, polite and fun! The food itself was delicious and though the pouring of the wine within the pairing was a little less (quantity wise) than what we're used to, it was still a great addition. The Espresso Martinis were great, the quantity of food left us feeling perfectly full and the quality of most dishes was A* (the octopus and pigeon my partner had were not cooked to his liking but that may have been just preference). If I had to nit-pick I'd say towards the end the speed at which the wine & food came was quite slow and we could have done with an in-between cocktail. The vibes were great, even though one song by Kylie Minogue played at least 7 times, but we had a good laugh about it. Loved the decor - especially the neon lights. I would say the price compared to other tasting menus at this caliber was a little steep, however nothing to complain about. Would definitely come again for a another menu, perhaps within a different season!"
d1408533,November 2021,50,Amsterdam,"Been on a lot of trips here an never disappointing, always great to see the streets lit up with Xmas lights just adds to the trip"
d1408533,November 2021,50,"Should be a 2 star, this place is amazing ❤️","Very well deserved Michelin star for this restaurant. I had such an amazing time with my family for my birthday celebration.  Very young and professional team, always ready to help you with enthusiasm, it change from classic Michelin service.  All 8 dishes were balanced and perfectly mastered."
d1408533,November 2021,20,"Bad service, does not get a cool location into a nice place","What a disappointment. As such the location is cool and we came with big expectation. However, I have never experienced such bad service in a one star Michelin restaurant. Have been greeted at the entrance friendly and encompassed to our table. All good up to then. Our waitress was in bad mood and did let us feel this as well. We did not really felt welcomed. We ordered champagne for aperitif. She filled in the Glas and I doubt that this was the normal 0,1 glass. We got the wine list before we saw the menu. The sommelier nevertheless was good and made good proposals however always more expensive then the wine we thought about. The waitress are more chosen by their looking then by their hospitality or charme. Yes it is a cool place but if you want to be really cool, then let tge guest feel it. Several times we had to ask to get more wine of our bottle. None asked us whether we want to have red wine for the main course or a dessert wine for the dessert. We feels liked ignored. In the end one waitress wanted to take our wine glasses, but we told her that there should be more wine in our bottle. She never came back. We had to ask another waitress and quite unwillingly got the bottle which had two glasses left. The food was good but not really exceptional. No real aroma explosion which you would expect in a one star Micheline restaurant. I really wonder why they have received the star. If you want to see waitress looking like models in a cool place go there, otherwise avoid it."
d1408533,September 2021,50,Very very nice food! Definitely,Very very nice food! Definitely Michelin worth. Gorgeous combination of flavors! A must to go in Amsterdam
d1408533,September 2021,40,Very good dinner,"I selected this restaurant based on the trajectory of the chef,  Beatiful ambiance and excellent music.  We started with their own Spicy Negroni,and it was delicious,we asked for the second one and it was not the same,although the bartender came to the table ,and prepared another one.  Food was very good although the menu is a little confusing ,I prefer eating a la carte .  When we were leaving the bartender offered a shot of the spicy gin they use for the Negroni!"
d1408533,July 2021,40,Very good!,"We have been here with friends for a dinner. Very nice place to bee, nice food and service. I loved the appetizers...I'll be back !"
d3200493,October 2022,40,Nice breakfast,"Friendly staff, cosy place. The food was really good, the eggs were excellent and the portions were generous. Just be sure to reserve a table!"
d3200493,August 2022,40,Nice relaxing canal side breakfast,"Good breakfast with a nice canal view. Very good portion size and lots of quality ham on the eggs Benedict!  Would had been 5 out of 5 but I think it’s too much for breakfast, almost €50 for 2 drinks and 2 breakfasts was not really what we had budgeted for oops.  However, if you want really good quality then come here but it’s just on the pricey side compared to many other places for breakfast"
d3200493,July 2022,50,Excellent brunch or breakfast,"Lovely canalside spot for breakfast, with an excellent range of choices on the menu. Good size portions and typically priced for the centre of town. Friendly and quick service - worth the wait, there was a queue every time we walked past!"
d3200493,August 2022,40,"Nice food, big portions. Pretty expensive.","I visited Greenwoods with my kids. There are no Dutch menu's, everything is English. We did like the food although for kids it was way too much. The prices are definitely on the high end..."
d3200493,August 2022,50,AMAZING!!!!,"Amazing service, honest food that’s delicious. Great drinks. I ordered the salmon royale and it was out of this world. The staff here are also very kind and hardworking. I highly recommend!!!!"
d3200493,July 2022,50,The perfect pit stop,Had to wait a while for a table and it truly paid dividends. A diverse but neat brunch menu. We had the pancakes with scrambled eggs and bacon which were delicious. Table service excellent . Enjoy
d3200493,June 2022,50,Excellent Breakfast,"Next to the canal, but we chose to dine indoors as It was a windy morning. Wall murals depicting Dutch history. Excellent food with friendly service."
d3200493,July 2022,50,Family food and gluten free,We had a tables booked in little place as my wife is gluten free there was a lot of options for her lovely setting by the canal all our food was spot on the waitress was a very nice Irish girl really helpful and also very busy we have been to one of these in edinburgh and this was just as good portions are large and we were all very full thanks guys keep up the good work
d3200493,June 2022,50,Lovely brunch visit,Amazing little brunch spot. Our server was from Ireland and was the most accommodating. The eggs in the shakshouka were perfectly cooked. Ginger tea was excellent and even though we showed up near they didn’t rush us out as it approached closing time.    Our favourite outdoor brunch on the canal experience.
d3200493,April 2022,40,Great place and friendly staff,Came to Greenwoods for breakfast. The egg Benedict was delicious. Liis was absolutely lovely and very friendly. Would definitely recommend this place for breakfast and Lunch!
d3200493,April 2022,50,Lovely Breakfast....,"Luckily, we were in time before the queues started, though the cafe was still very busy. Breakfast was lovely, and service was great also. I would highly recommend this place. We had the veggie breakfast, Shakshuka and French Toast. Hot chocolate was great also."
d3200493,April 2022,50,Excellent breakfast,Excellent breakfast. The food was exceptional and lots of choice the pancakes were delicious. The staff were friendly too.
d3200493,March 2022,50,Tremendously good,"This was a near perfect breakfast experience...two days running. The choice is great. New Amsterdam Eggs Benedict was fantastic......the pancakes too. Coffee good as well. Staff fantastic. Great ambience and socially aware not using avocados because of the environmental impact. Staff very skilled as bringing three plates down a spiral staircase...without accident!"""
d3200493,April 2022,40,Great service!,"The food was incredible hear, fantastic coffee and particularly excellent service from Ebbonnie who seemed overworked but did a great job anyway! Highly recommend this place for a brunch any time of the year. Shame the terrace didn’t open until 2 hours after our reservation but inside turned out to be very nice."
d3200493,March 2022,50,Perfect brunch!,"A really diverse brunch menu and really filling (didn’t need to eat for the rest of the day…!) when it came. I had the pancakes and the scrambled eggs were a treat as was the bacon - smoothies also hit the spot. Eb, our waitress, was very sweet - looked after us!"
d8562698,October 2022,30,Nice place for breakfast with lots of omelet and egg choices,"Strangely, couples were directed to tables for 2 while men coming in by 2 were taken to tables for 4…the mushroom and cheese omelet I selected was OK but I would have preferred it with a less pungent cheese. Coffee and bread were good.    Place opens early which is an advantage."
d8562698,August 2022,50,absoultley the best,"These guys take eggs to the next level, what a great place. Shame its so busy but its a great thing, peanut butter omelette was amazing"
d8562698,September 2022,50,Just great,"Great food and great location. Well worth tracking down this place. Staff are friendly, welcoming and the food is even better."
d8562698,July 2022,50,Big Ben,Big Ben is the best i think. But its little bit expencive althought it shown cheapest like “ $ “. Enjoy with your meal 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
d8562698,June 2022,50,So delicious!,"Great brunch, fun lineup, sweet cozy bright place, friendly and engaging staff. Fresh juice, delicious omelettes."
d8562698,July 2022,50,Amazing food,"Worth the wait, lovely small place with the best omelette I ever had in my life. Defined will go back and try the other ones! The queue always looks big but it moves fast so wait, trust me you will not regret. The service is so polite and kind that adds more value to the experience"
d8562698,June 2022,20,Very dissapointed - overpriced and bad,"When I ordered an omelette it came very fast - which was nice. However it was very undercooked. I asked the server if I could please have a new one that was properly cooked and when she came with the ""new"" plate it was literally the same. They had just taken the omelette I just complained about and given it 1 more minute on the stove. The apple juice I ordered was almost warm not even close to cooled. The atmosphere is very nice but in no way compensates for the bad food."
d8562698,June 2022,20,Not so good,"It wasn’t that good as reviews suggest, it wasn’t worth the que or the wait for table. Omelette wasn’t cooked properly was soggy."
d8562698,June 2022,30,"If you have good requirements, this is not the place for you.","There were things I could potentially have, and I asked if they could be modify but the answer was no. I just had an orange juice while my husband had the Shakshuka dish.    If you are vegan, diary free, or potentially don’t like a dish and ask if they could make some changes, it won’t possible."
d8562698,June 2022,10,Not family friendly. Parents beware,"We were literally just kicked out by the manager because we came with our baby who was sleeping in her stroller.    We sat at the table and had coffee, then asked if we can move to another table where employees wouldn't keep bumping into the stroller. The manager then said ""we're not baby friendly"" then asked us to leave.    Worst experience in Amsterdam which is normally super friendly to parents."
d8562698,May 2022,40,They do Omelettes better than anyone!,"We waited quite a while to get a table and the menu is limited, but there is a reason for that - their omelettes are the best!! My food was incredible and the friends I was with found the same with theirs. We would highly recommend eating here!"
d8562698,June 2022,50,A tasty brekkie in a cute setting,Well worth a visit. Tasty food served by friendly staff in quite a cute little restaurant. Freshly squeezed juice and good coffee with a choice of omelettes make a great start to your day.
d8562698,May 2022,40,Very good,Very nice breakfast. Large omelette very well prepared and tasty. Great ingredients. Overall good and very reasonable value for the money
d8562698,March 2022,30,Overrated,"Lady that served us was very friendly, staff were nice. Breakfast was average at best. For the price I don’t think we will return."
d8562698,November 2021,10,Felt very unsafe,"Food is fine for breakfast choices. However the tables are crammed in, the staff don’t wear masks and this was the one cafe / restaurant we visited in Amsterdam where there was no attempt made to check whether we had a negative LFD in the preceding 24 hours. Everywhere else we went, including the museums, seats outside cafes, the boat trip, checked our QR codes and ID before we were allowed over the threshold. This felt quite unsafe. They did not check anyone."
d8567150,November 2022,50,Highly recommend,"Friendly and attentive service. Delicious food. Lovely, comfortable restaurant. Relaxed atmosphere. We loved it! Thank you"
d8567150,October 2022,50,"Very good food & services, unique dining spot",I had dinner here with a friend of mine and we were not disappointed. Very cozy and personal atmosphere and excellent dinner. We both had a starter and main course ( 1x fish and 1x meat ). Nice wine list. I would def come back here once!
d8567150,October 2022,50,Brilliant culinary experience,"This dining experience was exceptional. Besides the warm and welcoming dining space, waiter Sil showed skilled expertise in serving us a highly memorable meal. He has a bright future. Additionally, William D took command of the space and answered culinary queries with extraordinary expertise.    The menu is clever, multi-faceted, and engaging.    Best meal in two weeks in Europe - including Paris , bar none.    Don't miss !"
d8567150,October 2022,50,"Excellent food, service, and atmosphere","The food and wine were excellent, as was the service. The dining room and other dining area/bar were both charming and cozy, with lovely art and ambiance."
d8567150,October 2022,50,Complimentary breakfast with hotel room was superb,"Wonderful complimentary breakfast with hotel room served in Brasserie Ambassade at the Ambassade Hotel. Superb service, great food and lovely dining room overlooking a quiet tree lined street beside the canal. Made-to-order hot breakfast entrees (we tried eggs Benedict with bacon -- yum!) and delicious made-to-order cappuccinos and lattes, a fabulous breakfast buffet filled with delicious pastries, flaky croissants to die for, and a variety of baked breads, assorted fruits, Dutch and French cheeses, hard boiled eggs, assorted meats and smoked salmon, yogurts and cereals. All served quickly by super friendly staff who went out of their way to make you feel welcome."
d8567150,October 2022,50,Lovely Dining Experience,We enjoyed the Brasserie Ambassade very much. We began in the bar and had perfectly prepared cocktails. The ambiance in the library dining room was so special and unique. Our food was delicious and we wished that we had not discovered this gem so late in our trip!
d8567150,August 2022,50,Good food,The food was very good and was at a reasonable price for quality of restaurant. Also good choice and price of wine.
d8567150,September 2022,50,Delicious,"Excellent meal in an amazing setting. Fabulous vegan option and lovely friendly staff, would definitely recommend the Zucchini."
d8567150,September 2022,30,Not good enough.,"We ordered the chicken. The menu said it came with potatoes but we were not given any. So, the two of us had a thin chicken breast with a tiny bit of lettuce and two mushrooms for 25 euros each. Laughable. It tasted nice but was not worth it. Service pleasant but our waitress seemed a bit rushed off her feet. A slightly dispiriting experience. We should’ve complained but after a tiring day we couldn’t be bothered."
d8567150,August 2022,50,Delicious food in a lovely calm environment,"We ate here in the evening as a family of four. The food was delicious - from the vegetarian main (courgette cooked many ways); the confit duck; to the children's chicken, which was succulent and accompanied by apple sauce. The staff were attentive and discreet and we had a lovely time. Well worth it and we would go again in a heartbeat."
d8567150,August 2022,50,Beautiful hotel and great service,We stayed in one of the Suoerior rooms overlooking the canal and it was great. The room was comfortable and beautifully appointed. The staff was very helpful. Can't say enough good things about the Hotel Ambassede.
d8567150,August 2022,50,Excellent all round,"Excellent food, well served and nice decor (we ate in the library area). It was so good we went back twice more."
d8567150,July 2022,50,Fantastic food,We enjoyed the wonderful food in the intimate setting of the library with a fully stocked bar. Christa provided exceptional service during our meal and Sebastian was always ready to make us a perfect drink. The food was fantastic and so convenient to return to our rooms. The hotel and Brasserie are fantastic
d8567150,August 2022,50,Great Experience,"Really nice, well located with good service and perfect rooms hotel. We stayed for 1 night. By request if there is an opportunity that can extend check out."
d8567150,August 2022,40,Worth another visit...,"Took a seat on small sidewalk terrace.  Group sitting near mme on 2 tables. Mmaybe I got mmissed as it took quite a while before I was approached. Perhaps busy inside. I just patiently enjoyed canal boaters and people wandering by.    Quick late lunch. Iced-coffee with a dusting of chocolate served with a stainless steel straw!    An arrange of beverages to choose fromm. ""Bites"" - only on mmenu such as cheese plate, snack mix, etc. I tool jalapeno bites which camme with chili sauce and pickled mmix.    They have a limmited mmenu right now as they are not currently serving lunch yet. Will have to go back then.    Restaurant gets awesomme reviews!    isabelydancer00"

d6022573,October 2022,50,A hidden gem... worth seeking out.,"Came across this restaurant by chance, and what a find.

d6022573,June 2022,50,"One of the best Indian in the city, if not 'the' one.","With small seating place inside, I went there in a rainy day and had to wait a bit more than my reservation time. The owners felt bad about that and kept giving me drinks outside and apologizing. I didn't mind waiting in the neighbourhood, and it worth it.    Food was just great and service was super!"
d6022573,September 2022,50,BEEESSTTT INDIAN FOOOD in Amsterdam,Amazing food Indian. Best chicken tikka and momos. We stayed 6 nights in Amsterdam and we had food here 4 times. The owner so aphable so lovable.. Much recommended.
d6022573,September 2022,50,Foodgasm,Most authentic Nepali food and vibe in Amsterdam. The people are friendly too which is a bonus to visit the place. Amazed
d6022573,September 2022,50,Super,The little hidden Gem inside busy street. Small restaurant but incredible food and service . Three courses shared dining gives tremendous taste and feelings.

d10071792,October 2022,50,A little gem,"A tiny little jewel of a restaurant. Wonderful food and flavours, great ambience and attentive service. Would definitely come back"
d10071792,October 2022,50,Behind the Mask..,"…is a lovely little restaurant slightly off the main drags. Great intimate little Italian restaurant that was full both nights we ate there. Staff really friendly and made us all feel really welcome. Food was outstanding - loin of rabbit and pancetta was so good my wife had it both nights and the pasta with Norcia sausage and the baccala with raisins/onions on chickpea base was fantastic too. Real mixed crowd of diners from tourists like us, to small groups of businesspeople and locals. Bravo La Maschera !!"
d10071792,September 2022,50,Lovely dinner,This place is very cozy and a little off the beaten path but the food is amazing and the service was extremely good. Homemade pasta as good as in Italy.
d10071792,July 2022,50,Tasty birthday dinner,"Came here for a birthday dinner and had a delicious meal. Excellent food and a lovely ambiance, highly recommend for a great Italian food experience."
d10071792,May 2022,50,Food experience at La Maschera Amsterdam,Absolutely authentic and high quality Italian food. On top of that the service was just outstanding. Absolutely a must visit when in Amsterdam looking for fantastic food and a just as excellent service.
d10071792,May 2022,50,Excellent dinner.,Authentic italian cuisine and we enjoyed our meal. Easy going and cozy restaurant. Open view to kitchen and it was nice to watch how meals were prepared.
d10071792,May 2022,50,Fantastic Italian food,"Cosy restaurant, great service, delicious food and tasty wine! We had home made ravioli, one of the best pumpkin soups of my life, typical antipasti and dark gnocchi! Soooo goood!"
d10071792,May 2022,50,Delicious and friendly!,Small menu but delicious and fresh food! Very friendly service with well wine knowledge. Appreciate it!
d10071792,April 2022,50,"Great food, fast and friendly service","We really enjoyed our food and had a chat with the friendly restaurant owner, too.    Everything was well cooked, and we were so happy with the quality of food the team was able to produce considering the size of the restaurant. We had a good choice of wines and there were also some daily specials."
d10071792,April 2022,20,Non dedicated service,"We had reserved a table for 4 people. Looking forward when er arrived. The waiter several times tried to get us to order more expensive choices for starters, main and wines. E.g. Er ordered two glaces of wine (pinot grigio (8 EUR) and a ""Rosso"" blend (9 EUR)). Hej suggested a glass of Barolo for 16 EUR. When I politely insisted on my first choice, the atmosphere changed altogether and all food was served with a ""enjoy"" while walking away. Food was for all three courses, ok quality, but not more, and did not equal the relatively high Prices (and you really have to like melted mozzarella...). Many better Italian eating places in Amsterdam."
d10071792,February 2022,50,Mjammie!,Fantastic food friendly service fantastic Wines ! Typical italian style Just the way I like it! Dishes with truffle are amazing !
d10071792,December 2021,30,"Average food , overpriced , no COVID check","The food was good , however overpriced . The place could benefit from better hygiene . Quite concerning that they do not bother to follow the covid measures . We sat at the table and we were not asked for a QR check ."
d10071792,November 2021,50,Best real Italian restaurant in town!,"The food! The wines! The atmosphere! Everything is memorable. Go for a proper evening out, not for a quick bite. Indulge yourself."
d10071792,October 2021,10,"OVERPRICED, FOOD NOT EVEN AVERAGE","What a disappointment! Extremely overpriced (to the point of rudeness) and the food is just not worth it! As someone who knows Italian cuisine this was just one very bad experience! Moreover, it smells horribly inside and the placemats were dirty! The stuff is fine but not nearly enough to compensate for the rest! I really do not recommend!!!!"
d10071792,August 2021,30,Bit too much salt and a little too expensive,"Nice little restaurant in the lovely district of Jordaan. The menu is very will constructed and there were some highlights like the antipasti, however the mains were quite salty. One of the specials was the lamb balls with summer truffles for €30 and although was tasty, the portion size was more like a starter and in fact they could have been lamb balls as they were so small. Not sure if I would go back as there are better Italian restaurants in the area in my opinion."
d3589045,November 2022,50,A wonderful evening; food and staff outstanding,Location: Just a 5 min walk from the Rembrandtsplein so very central with a tram very close. In good weather with a nice opportunity to walk alomg the Grachten.
d3589045,November 2022,50,Amazing experience,"From the dishes with their very innovative way of presenting and the twists in tastes to the service, that is beyond impeccable... A real travel experience trough tastes from different places! The perfect combination, thank you!"
d3589045,October 2022,50,The most incredible meal,"The atmosphere was lovely, the staff were all really friendly and helpful. the food was incredible. We had the full experience and there was loads of snacks in between courses and the pace was good too. We even got an extra treat because it was our anniversary"
d3589045,October 2022,50,Amazing,My wife and myself came here to celebrate our 20th Anniversary.  Could not fault the food or the service.  Food was out of this world.  Only thing I would say is the restaurant is attached to a hotel and there is only 2 toilets available. Which half way through night wasn't upto standard that the restaurant of that calibre should be expected
d3589045,October 2022,50,"Wow, wow, wow!","Based on TripAdvisor laudatory reviews, my husband and I made a dinner reservation for our last night in Amsterdam. What a fabulous choice! We ordered the 4-course dinner with wine pairings. We’re pretty sophisticated eaters, but I have to admit I had never eaten mackerel or quail before. Both the presentation and preparation of each course, which incorporated Asian elements, were fantastic. Staff graciously replaced the beef course with a vegetarian choice for me. Kudos to the chef for his creative and delicious food and the sommelier for her excellent wine selections. Senses absolutely deserves its Michelin recognition and many 5-star reviews."
d3589045,October 2022,50,5 course Menu,"What a great experience!!!! Best customer service and I loved the way all the staff would speak to you - just not one individual server. Myself and my partner don’t really like wine but the larger was insanely good .  Course ratings:  Starter bread sticks; 9.1/10 (complimentary)  Mushroom with foam; 9.8/10  Eel tacos ; 10/10  Breads 9.2/ 10  Mackerel 10/10  Langoustine 9.9/10  Prawn toast 9.4/ 10  Place; 9.5/10  Beef : 10/10 love love love love  Dessert peach; 6/10  Main dessert 6/10    Absolutely amazing food and quite critical above as the only way to improve is to add more In terms of quantity . The desserts for us could have been the only part made better . I was expecting something Rich and super sweet but it was quite mild and a bit above standard .    The restaurant gave us a nice extra treat at the end as a surprise . So nice and lovely . Will definitely come back , one of the best restaurants around be ever been to."
d3589045,October 2022,30,Great food but lacked a personal touch,No issues with the quality of the food - every course was excellent. Unfortunately they lacked that special something. They were aware it was a birthday dinner for my partner and in an email a few days before the booking had promised a card and special small cake - but failed to deliver either on the day with a meagre verbal ‘I understand it is your birthday’ when we arrived and nothing else. A shame that a restaurant of this calibre falls short on any personal touch.
d3589045,October 2022,50,OUT OF THIS WORLD!,"I have travelled extensively and consider that I have eaten in some of the best restaurants in the world, 'SENSES' is way way up there. The quality of the food is truly exceptional. The fusion of tastes created by the chef reflects his creative imagination.  I will go back to Amsterdam, principally to taste the quality of the food again."
d3589045,October 2022,50,Wonderful birthday dinner,"We celebrated my daughters birthday with a 6 course dinner. Everyting was splendid: the quality of the dishes and the original wine pairing. Very good bread with soft butter, and all this served by enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff. Extra kudos to our sweet Swedish sommelier. This place deserves a Michelin star."
d3589045,September 2022,50,Just superb,"Amazing culinary experience, can’t rate it highly enough. Went for the All in 6 course experience with wine pairing and couldn’t fault it."
d3589045,September 2022,50,Amazing,We had an amazing dining experience. Both the food and service was excellent and we felt like we got way over our money’s worth. 6/5 stars.
d3589045,September 2022,50,Perfect!,A perfect evening with an outstanding tasting menu and service! Excellent wine and food pairings. We will definitely visit Senses again.
d3589045,September 2022,50,Tantalising tastebud experience,"An unexpected melange of courses which are explained in front of you and cooked in the kitchen in view. We had 5 courses. Well thought out small dishes that sometimes surprised my tastebuds. We did the wine flite but you really don’t have to. The venue is small & contemporary, service fast, sharp paced and attentive but if you’d rather choose your food, it’s not the place to go."
d3589045,September 2022,50,Fantastic evening.,Fantastic evening at Senses. The restaurant were very accommodating allowing us to mix different menu options amongst the six at our table. The Ultimate Senses experience was wonderful. The food a visual treat with fantastic flavours. The half glass wine pairing was a great idea allowing diners to have the full tasting experience with (a bit) more moderation. The staff were friendly and welcoming. Our sommelier was particularly enthusiastic and knowledgable. We very much enjoyed her explanations. One member of the party was unable to drink and enjoyed a lovely non alcoholic sparkling. The whole meal took all evening although we really lost track of time enjoying our seven courses. A real treat and definitely worth it.
d3589045,September 2022,50,Gourmet tasting menu in cozy relaxed atmosphere..,Small cozy and relaxed atmosphere. It doesnt have the michelin star yet but they are close i guess.. the tasting menu consists of small and gourmet selection of seafood and meat. You can choose a pairing wine menu as well. The staff is young and friendly - the service is quite fast and organized especially considering that you are having a 6-7 course menu. I an happy to have this experience. 6 course menu - 2 glasses of wine at 120 euro approx. per person
d8528923,November 2022,40,"Great combo of food, nice and skillful sommelier and location!","Beautiful location right opposite the Ei and close to Amsterdam Central station. Parking will be a bit of a challenge. We had dinner here on the top level (the restaurant has two levels). It offers a great view across the Ij river and the atmosphere is relaxed and private. Food was nice, we had the 6-course menu. Especially the wine pairing was great; the sommelier has a very enthusiastic way of presenting the wines. The food was very nice, but not really outstanding compared to other 1-star Michelin restaurants. The cooking is definitely up to par with the 1 star Michelin level. Other 1-star restaurants that I have visited really aimed for the second star and you spot the difference between those. Price wise it is a bit expensive if you just compare it with other one star restaurant. But the great location adds to the price at well! Nice to have visited and definitely recommend it because of the combination of food, nice and skillful sommelier and location."
d8528923,October 2022,50,Great dinning experience,Great dinning experience with a wonderful view of Amsterdam Thank you fantastic Henry for the warm welcome and for explaining us every little detail of the party of senses that the chef gave to our palate !
d8528923,October 2022,50,Book before you travel,"Lovely fine dining experience! Had tried to book this great Michelin star restaurant for dinner, but unfortunately was booked out. We were lucky to have lunch here. Arrived into restaurant looking fairly harassed as we had just moved hotels. The restaurant manager and waiter (unfortunately didn’t get their names) immediately set us at ease. From start to finish, a great dining experience. The different courses were explained to us in detail. With each course we were getting more relaxed. Very tasty dishes and nice to see the chefs at work in the background! Well worth a visit! Special mention has to go to the kind way and words of the very pleasant manager"
d8528923,October 2022,50,Perfect Lunch,"The restaurant is excellent. Intimate, comfortable, with very friendly, attentive staff. The location has amazing views of the dock. The food was delicious, with complex flavours and some ingredients new to us. The wines were also excellent."
d8528923,October 2022,50,Excellent,"This restaurant deserves their ""star"". The food is delightfully varied in flavours and textures, the service outstanding and the views superb."
d8528923,October 2022,30,Undeserved Michelin star…,Restaurant location on the suggestive harbour. Room on three levels large and extremely noisy ... The background music too high made it difficult to converse. Friendly but haughty and unpleasant staff. Good food but nothing special... Biblical waiting times. High price! It doesn't deserve the Michelin star.
d8528923,September 2022,50,Would dine here every evening if we could!,"This was our second trip to Amsterdam from United States, and our second trip to MOS. Nothing compares. We appreciate it even more than the most fabulous restaurants in Paris. The cuisine is exceptional. The wine steward, Henry, is the best we have encountered. The staff are personable and -- it seems -- empathic. And the ambience is what post-holiday dreams are made of. Bravo, MOS!"
d8528923,September 2022,50,"Wonderful adventure, a must visit","We had lunch at MOS, and everything about the experience was brilliant, food, service, view and space. And, we have a lot of allergies and they supported so well, adjusted so that we loved and felt safe, welcome."
d8528923,August 2022,50,Worthy of its star,"We went for an early dinner on our last day in Amsterdam,l. Very friendly welcome and service throughout. Excellent meal, the sauce with the meat was a bit too rich for my wife, but If like me you like traditional french cooking then you will enjoy it."
d8528923,July 2022,50,Near Perfection - wonderful evening of fine dining,"We were part of Viking Cruise and decided to have dinner at MOS. I reserved a table for two several weeks before leaving California. The restaurant continued to inform me of changes due to the heatwave, rare in restaurant business. Upon arrival via a taxi, a young man opened the door to welcome us, showed us to the upstairs corner table over looking the river, what a view.  Two individuals performed most of the service, a young woman and the sommelier. Unfortunately, I never got to learn about their names. Regardless, they were both professional and knowledgeable on the food and wine. The real magical show began with a few amuse bouche. They blew open my tastebuds, at the same time, beautiful to look at. Wine pairing was also near perfection. My initial thoughts were that a couple wines weren’t really fit my personal preference, but when paired with the dish, it was simply divine. A good lesson learned. Excellent service moved smoothly throughout the almost 3.5 hour meal, and wish it could be longer. All the courses were well designed and executed. Some ingredients were totally transformed into unrecognizable morsels. Super impressed. The team called us a taxi and we were ushered out to the car by the nice gentleman who assisted the team during service.  We dined in at least one Michelin starred restaurants that we visit around the world, MOS stands near the top of our list of favorites. I told the team on the way out that I would love to be dining here again, soon. Somehow, I plan to return to Amsterdam and experience another magical night.  Thank you all who were responsible to make our dinner such a memorable occasion. I will remember it for a long time."
d8528923,June 2022,50,Choose MOS!,"Great food, great ambiance. Just an all around good Michelin-star in an interesting part of Amsterdam. Good service and very conversation-friendly owner! Also offered a real nice rhum as avec which was a nice round-off to a super pleasant evening."
d8528923,May 2022,50,Very nice,"Great food, superb service and the view is wonderful. Went for our anniversary and we were very well looked after. The paired wines that we had with some of our five courses were superb. Great value given what you get."
d8528923,July 2022,50,Just delicious and great service,"A very elegant and quiet venue, on a quay overlooking the river, with parking nearby.  A very sophisticated wine list, enthousiast and knowledgeable staff. But most importantly, a very well balanced menu with an array of delicious, extremely well executed dishes. Definitely meriting it’s one Michelin star, and promising more.    We loved the whole experience, and we will be back for sure. Also a very great option for excellent business lunches."
d8528923,June 2022,50,Spectacular in every way,"This restaurant is off the charts. Worthy of a Michelin star, plus the location on the water is beautiful and the service was first rate and informative and FUN. Steve was one of the finest waitstaff I have ever had the pleasure and the owner himself was working the tables and telling great stories of the restaurant's history and food. Do not hesitate."
d8528923,June 2022,50,"Food, location, service and ambiance all top","Lucky to find a table for 6. The location is wonderful, overlooking the water and for those that arrive by car, underground parking is avialable. We were not disappointed. Service was excellent, the sommelier was very helpful and we had a truly enjoyable evening with excellent food and wine."
d1309073,November 2022,50,Great Bfast,"Lovely little place, super busy! Be prepared to queue, but worth the wait if you love a quality breakfast!"
d1309073,October 2022,50,Great restaurant. Worth the wait.,"You will probably have to line up to get it, but it is worth the wait. The scones are world class! I had a truffle Benedict dish, wish was pretty good, but I think you should go for scones or pancakes with some eggs and bacon on the side."
d1309073,October 2022,50,Incredible food and great staff,We came here for breakfast prior to a busy day exploring the city and it did not disappoint! There was a bit of a wait for a table but it was so worth it and the staff were incredibly friendly and fast! Would highly recommend visiting!
d1309073,October 2022,50,Breakfast,"Really good food, a bit more expensive for breakfast but fresh good food was worth it. The homemade soda bread is good. Eggs Benedict comes on a harder bun than normal. The scrambled eggs was good, had a good mix of veggies with it too"
d1309073,October 2022,50,Return customers,"Every Time I come to Amsterdam, without a doubt I come by greenwoods, perfect meal and service. Not a bad word to say!"
d1309073,October 2022,50,Amazing food!,"I love everything about this place! Food was amazing! Staff are friendly, coffee is lovely! 100% recommended. Location is great and inside is nice and cozy. With no doubt the best is the food, delicious flavours and great presentation. Honestly thanks to the chefs for always taking such good care of me whenever I’m in town!"
d1309073,October 2022,50,Excellent recommendation,"Recommended and so glad I followed it up. Maybe a short wait outside if busy but the food is excellent and the service is excellent too. Must have tried 5 different meals and all great, the pancake stack is a must.."
d1309073,October 2022,30,Good but expensive,"6 euro for an iced tea, almost 4 euro for a capuccino, the average dish is 16.95, the service is verh good but long queues outside"
d1309073,October 2022,50,10/10 full English breakfast,"THE BEST BREAKFAST! The full English is 10/10 You have to wait outside for about 20/30 minutes for a table, but it’s worth the wait!"
d1309073,October 2022,20,Not very good breakfast and expensive.,"It is a cost place and nice area. Very nice to sit outside. However, it’s not a great breakfast place if you’re looking for a proper nice breakfast. It’s more of a brunch spot. It is not possible to do free choices or combine anything. All the dishes are too tweaked and advance, and way too complicated to be seen as a breakfast place. The portions are huge, which is not sustainable. However, they offer you a “doggy bag”."
d1309073,October 2022,50,Worth the wait!,"Visited here for breakfast after struggling to find anywhere nice by our hotel in Amsterdam - wasn’t disappointed. Food & service was both excellent, was 100% worth the wait."
d1309073,October 2022,50,Delicious brunch food,"We had brunch here after walking past it every time we were going back to the hotel and thinking how delicious the food looked.    The restaurant doesn't take bookings so you do have to queue, but we went on a weekday, around 11, and only queued for about 10 minutes which we were happy to do.    The food in question arrived really quickly and was delicious. I had the truffle benedict, which was something a bit different and would definitely recommend."
d1309073,October 2022,50,The best restaurant in Amsterdam,"I went to Amsterdam 4 times and this is one of the best restaurant there I assure you, the customer service is amazing the staff is very friendly and the food is mwah delicious hands up to the amazing manger and everyone else."
d1309073,October 2022,50,Cozy and delicious,Great location along one of the canals. Cozy little place with excellent food. I had the special with poached egg on asparagus and beets which was incredible. My wife had the French toast and loved it.
d1309073,September 2022,50,Excellent,Delicious brunch menu. Nice staff. Cosy environment. Little waiting time. Very close to the center without the crowds.
d2315768,September 2022,50,Amsterdam at its finest,"Last meal in Amsterdam was a total blast. Utterly blown away by the level of attention to details & sustainability code of conduct at @restaurant.flore.    2 Michelin ⭐️⭐️ as well as 1 Michelin showcase nothing but pure magic inside the walls of the new reopened Dutch extravaganza.    Sea snails, cuttlefish, escargots, the most beautiful indulging cooked veggies and one of the best sourdough I ever tried, topped off with silky homemade oregano oil.    The front of house service was on point throughout the night and very helpful with tons of information about the concept, the project and the questions that had arise during dinner. Very well trained and top notch in terms of professionalism.    It is certain that Amsterdam’s dining scene can easily be compared to the great gastronomic getaways of the world, living in a future of culinary respect, evolution and imagination. Well done, guys. Nothing but pure appreciation towards you all."
d2315768,May 2022,50,Superb,"Absolutely outstanding. Food quality, creativity, presentation, superb wine pairing, excellent staff. Do not miss Flore! We enjoyed a 5-hour dinner; highlight of our trip. Experience matched a 2-star Michelin."
d2315768,November 2021,50,Great evening,"We had an absolutely amazing experience here. The food was so good and the service was spectacular. The service here was unreal too, I can't recommend this restaurant enough. It is a must try spot!"
d2315768,October 2021,20,Food is not tasty. Very slow,Food is not tasty. Very slow service. High price. I cannot recommend this place for a good time with your friends or family.
d2315768,September 2021,10,Extremely ridiculous!,So you want to plan a special evening for a special person…. Booked a table and was notified that I had to pay €200 per person in order to finalize the booking! You have got to be kidding! This is so utterly outrageous I will refuse to eat there!
d2315768,August 2020,50,More than what we expected (from reviews),"Professional, diligent service. Surprising, excellent amuses before the diner had begun and even after!  Definitely returning with good friends or family.  Thank you so much for an unforgettable, mouth-watering evening :-)"
d2315768,January 2020,50,Loved every little bit!!!,"Came here while visiting our friends in town. Impeccable white glove service but without the stuffiness. In fact the staff were so friendly and hilarious we’d come back just for the service! Dinner was also an amazing adventure of flavors and textures, and we’d highly recommend the wine pairing. The view at night was also superb. Very thoughtfully curated restaurant experience. Would visit again!"
d2315768,May 2019,50,Delicate & modern Dutch fine dinning,"We enjoyed Bor’deaux On the last night of our stay at hotel de L’Europe, and one might say best for last. I don’t know if the dining room was so intimate and spacious because there weren’t a lot of reservations that evening, but there was a lot of space in between tables giving a nice feel of privacy. This is much more of a low-key and quiet restaurant than a glitzy restaurant. The quality of the food and the quality of the service makes up for the quiet atmosphere. Play full dishes and presentations, inspired cocktail selection which I enjoyed two of. I would definitely recommend this one Michelin star restaurant if you’re looking for some of the best local cuisine in Amsterdam in a quiet environment."
d2315768,October 2019,50,Original Amsterdam luxury,Elegant and classic fine dining. Michelin-starred restaurant in Amsterdam’s historic centre. Honoured by Wine Spectator 2018 for having one of the most outstanding restaurant wine lists in the world.
d2315768,November 2019,50,Above and beyond,"Dined at Bord’eau with my boyfriend and another couple. We each had the six-course menu with wine pairings. The food was simply sublime. Particular favorites at our table were a lamb heart amuse bouche, oyster and sea vegetables, partridge, langostino, venison, and hare. The night was made all the more magical thanks to our server, Mai, and the sommelier, Thijs. Thanks for an unforgettable evening — and for putting up with us after the wine hit us all a couple courses in."
d2315768,October 2019,40,Best brioche I’ve had + magnificent view,"Comprehensive wine selection, impeccable service and delicious food. Didn’t get the tasting menu because I was too full, 3 starters and 1 main course shared upon 2 people was a good choice."
d2315768,September 2019,50,Superb,"4 of us ate here for my wife’s birthday this weekend.    Firstly, the position is wonderful. We chose to eat outside having first noticed the restaurant while walking across the bridge opposite. The tables are laid out right next to the canal and enjoy lovely views.    The food And wine were excellent. 2 of us enjoyed beautifully cooked fish dishes and the other 2 enjoyed different cuts of steak which included good cuts of meat that were cooked to perfection. The prices are certainly not cheap here however for the quality of food you receive, I would consider that the prices are pitched about right and are appropriate versus other high quality venues we’ve visited in the past. In fact, the quality of food and service were significantly better than some venues for which we’ve paid much higher prices.    What really set this place apart for us though was the service. The staff were attentive without being invasive and demonstrated throughout that they really cared about our experience. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble. By way of example we changed table twice during the meal however I must stress that this was in no way due to any complaint or defect. In fact it was because there was a storm on its way! The staff had been watching the forecast and we were informed of the storm before ordering and given the choice of moving inside or to another table with more cover but we chose to remain at our initial table for the first course. When the winds arrived we then moved to another outside table which was under a little move cover and the staff kindly provided blankets for us so we could continue to enjoy our outside location. There was then a significant downpour so we then moved to an inside table and were each personally escorted with umbrellas.    To breakdown my rating I’ve given maximum available *s for all aspects of the experience but in all honesty I would give the staff many more, if they were available."
d2315768,July 2019,40,Great food and nice view,Inside on a rainy evening and still sitting on the edge og one of Amsterdam's many canals - not a bad start. Staff and food was excellent - can only recommend this nice restaurant.
d2315768,May 2019,30,They need to improve to keep their rating.,One Michelin star but neither the food nor the service matched that rating. The price was too high for what they offered.
d2315768,June 2019,50,Excellent service and food,a real culinary experience to a very reasonable price. Service was excellent. Food was creative and very tasty. Wine pairing worked very well. And the staff really tried to accomodate every wish we had to adjust the menu to our wishes. Highly recommended!
d4177229,September 2022,50,Egg cellent place for lunch.,"Excellent food, buzzy atmosphere and really friendly staff. Great for meat eaters and vegetarians with a very wide choice of options."
d4177229,July 2022,40,Good local joint for breakfast/brunch,"Brought here by a local friend we were spending the day with, this is one of her go-to spots for brunch with friends in the neighborhood. As the name would suggest, omelettes are their specialty but there are other options as well. A large menu with many options but many are very interesting. I went with the El Chorizo with spicy chorizo, mushroom, onion and farmer cheese. Jen went with the gorgonzola bacon with sun-dried tomatoes, chive and oregano. The flavor of them both was excellent and the size was sufficient to last several hours of wandering around Amsterdam."
d4177229,August 2022,50,10 out of 10,"The food was amazing, the taste was exquisite. It did not disappoint. I'd recommend the Scramble Royale & fresh pressed apple juice."
d4177229,August 2022,40,Great eggs…great service!,Atmosphere really good and the food is great! We had a Omelette and build your own. Big potions and very tasty. Good breakfast!
d4177229,July 2022,50,Par Excellance!,"There are scrambled eggs and then there are the eggs served at Omelegg! We had eaten at Omelegg in 2016 and were ecstatic when we found it again in July, 2022. The scrambled eggs were as rich as we had remembered. The croissants were just as light. And the prices were still reasonable. What more could we ask for? Wonderful, personal service. Great!"
d4177229,July 2022,20,VERY slow and unapologetic service completely ruins the experience.,"The food here is above average - an omelet isn't the easiest dish to get wrong, and the choice is large. But you will wait a LONG time for coffee and drinks, which will usually arrive long after you've finished eating. Of all meals, breakfast should be immediate. Coffee should arrive instantly. OJ should be readily available. And butter and/or jam should be provided without asking."
d4177229,July 2022,50,Tasty af,"We orderd omelettes, and it was the best omelette we have ever tasted! Want an incredible breakfast? Go here!!!! Will most likely go here every day next time im here."
d4177229,July 2022,40,Good breakfast spot - So many omelet choices!,You can really get a good omelet here with a wide selection. I tried the Halloumi with avocado. The taste is great but it was also a bit watery. The service was friendly and fast so that was nice. Would recommend
d4177229,July 2022,50,Great breakfast choice!,"We arrived early at 7:10 hoping to beat the crowd. Only 2 people were in the restaurant when we arrived, but many more arrived before we left. Service was friendly, efficient, and accommodating to English. We had the Greek and the Italian job omelettes. We enjoyed them both. Omelettes were served with salad and fresh bread. Highly recommend a visit!"
d4177229,May 2022,50,Want a good breakfast- visit this place,"Great place for breakfast, good quality and very reasonable prices.. Friendly staff.. we found recommendation on trip advisory and it didn’t disappoint…. Variety of choices for omelettes, you can crate your own as well, freshly squished orange juice and a good coffee"
d4177229,April 2022,50,Best Breakfast,"The food is so good.  Its made infront of you , so fresh, healthy and the quality is just divine.  The staff are friendly. You can see they work hard, they do not stop.  down side is be prepared to Que, also if you are a celiac, they use the same toaster for gluten free bread as normal bread which is a bit ofna let down. Portion sizes are amazing though. ❤"
d4177229,April 2022,50,Great place for bruch!,I had this wonderful meal with my friend when we visited Amsterdam. The place was so nice and warm and the dishes we ordered were terrific. Let's just say that even vegetables are delicious for a meat lover like me😘
d4177229,February 2022,20,Not for me,"Went to this place on our first morning. We were going on a tour so it was early and they were open. Nice small cosy place with a very pleasant waitress but our breakfast was cold, the eggs were rubbery and the sausage was barely cooked. When we left we went to a different place for a pancake as we weren’t full for our day ahead. Wouldn’t try it again."
d4177229,October 2021,40,It is what it says,The omelettes were tasty and the stuff was friendly and kind. Not the best breakfast place in Amsterdam but worth maybe a visit!
d4177229,September 2021,50,Cute place not too far from the central station,"Fantastic place to eat! It was so popular that there was a queue outside, but it was definitely worth waiting for. The food was delicious and the staff was friendly. Especially the new Spanish girl. It looks good too. If you're looking for a nice place for a date, this could be a nice option."
d3198485,October 2022,50,My oh my,I hereby confirm that the chateaubriand steak at Brasserie SenT is the best in the world. Been there 2 times
d3198485,October 2022,50,5 stars,5 stars!! Amazing food and atmosphere. This is most certainly the best meat in Amsterdam. My favourite. Friendly staff and cozy ambiance.
d3198485,August 2022,50,Exquisite dinning,"Perfect ambience, perfect food, perfect hospitality.. simply exquisite, we dinned here on my girlfriend’s birthday and the whole experience was just great"
d3198485,June 2022,50,Absolutely perfect barbecue!,"The food was absolutely delicious! We ordered side salads, Roast Pork Ribs and Lamb. The pork and lamb were perfectly barbecued with just the right amount of smokey flavour. The salads, fries and sauces the came with the meals were excellent too. It was a great night!"
d3198485,May 2022,50,Delicious Chateaubriand,"Very small, intimate venue. We were placed by the door at first, but asked to get moved when possible and our waiter fulfilled this request swiftly. Very fast, pleasant service. Delicious Rioja, Chateaubriand and Creme Brulee. Waiter was also helpful with recommending bars we could go to. Great trip and good value."
d3198485,May 2022,40,enjoyable,"The title "" brasserie "" conveys a lot about the style and ambiance and food aspirations of the restaurant .Clearly very busy and successful .Menu not trying to be too clever and focussing on fairly simple courses cooked well ..which they were . Dessert of three kinds of ice cream less successful ..overly sweet and all varieties almost indistinguishable .Service very pleasant and welcoming"
d3198485,May 2022,50,Nice place for a special dinner,"Lovely food and wine here. Must order the chateaubriand - delicious! Really enjoyed eating at one of their outdoor tables on a warm night. Quite an expensive evening, but everything did seem very high quality."
d3198485,April 2022,50,Very nice,"All food was good. There is a focus on meat but good fish and veggie options too. Don’t skip the starters, they were really excellent. We had a great table by the front window, looking out on a quiet, pretty street."
d3198485,October 2021,50,Perfect!,"Lovely little restaurant, great atmosphere and fabulous service. The food was spectacular, we had the chateaubriand and the snicker ice cream mousse for dessert and they were both so so good! Would definitely recommend and will definitely be back :)"
d3198485,October 2021,40,Cozy place with good food,We we a group of 10 people and we were told that not all dishes could be ordered because we were to big a group. We all ordered chateaubriand and it was a very good meal. Good selection of wines and very friendly waiter. It feels like a family place with good atmosphere.
d3198485,October 2021,50,Last night back in Europe...great way to end!,"My son decided we need to have one more night of French bistro food....no complaints here. This place was excellent. We had the Bao Bun pork appetizer and it was amazing....truly so. For mains, my son had the best lamb meal I have ever tasted. I had the pork loin and though very good could have cooked 2 minutes less. Desserts were excellent as well. Wine list was solid with lots of good options at good price points. Service was also excellent.    We will say we had a bit of food envy when we saw the shared steak plates go by.....looked awesome....but this just gives us another reason to go back in the future."
d3198485,September 2021,50,Do not hesitate....just go there and enjoy !,"Very good food within a very nice, cosy environment with very friendly personnel. So do not think and just go there to experience it !"
d3198485,September 2021,50,Highly Recommend,Had a great meal hear last week. Had the Lamb & Frites and it was spectacular. Nice spot in a great neibourhood.
d3198485,September 2021,50,Best meat,"Amazing meat and very good service…! We choose the feast aurante based on the review and it keep our expectations..! The meat was simply special combined with different sauces, good selection of wine and fair price…!! Recommend..!"
d3198485,August 2021,50,"Great service, delicious food","Can't believe we've only just found this place, it's been here 11 years. (Not on a main street, I think that's why.) Just super friendly and helpful, food some of the best pasta I've ever had."
d2292732,October 2022,50,We came back as promised - for more delicious food,After our last visit courtesy of an unexpected overnight thanks to KLM . As we promised this time we walked 30 minutes from our accommodation on our short stay in Amsterdam to again enjoy the fabulous vegetarian sharing plate all enhanced by a lovely bottle of red wine .    Next time we are in Amsterdam we will certainly be back to MAX
d2292732,October 2022,50,The best in town,Amazing!!!! Happy people !!! The staff is perfect !!! Amazing!!!! Happy people !!! The staff is perfect !!! Amazing!!!! Happy people !!! The staff is perfect !!!
d2292732,October 2022,50,Beautifully seasoned and presented Rijsttafel menu,"I was anxious to try a “rijsttafel” meal as we didn’t have time to do that on our short trip to Amsterdam in 2016. Thanks to excellent TripAdvisor reviews, I made a dinner reservation at MAX. My husband and I were absolutely delighted with our 2-course rice table meal, which started with the chicken satay on salad greens. The main course consisted of rice and 8 portions of beautifully prepared and seasoned Indonesian specialities. While we didn’t think everything offered was a standout, there was plenty of variety and more than enough for two people. Given the quantity and quality of food, the price is reasonable, and the wine list fairly priced. We enjoyed chatting with the owner, who rightfully takes pride in his food and service."
d2292732,October 2022,50,Amazing restaurant with an even more amazing owner.,"We originally had reservations at 5:45 of which I had to cancel. This restaurant has been on my wife's radar from before we came to Amsterdam.  We walked by the restaurant and asked if we could cancel our reservation and change it for 9:00. Max told me that they were booked put to pass by at 9:00 and he would try to accommodate us.  I'm so happy that we did get to eat there last night. We had the 5 course samplers menu and it did not disappoint. The owner Max took our order and served and explained the courses. I had never had Indonesian food before and was eager to try it.  The food was delicious,tasty,plated beautifully and the flavors were amazing. My tastebuds were alive with all the layers of flavors. Max came over and explained the meal and the flavors that we were tasting after every course.  Max is a charming,informative and wonderful owner that cares about his restaurant and the people that eat there. It was a pleasure to see an owner still have that passion for food. Would love to return one day and eat at his restaurant again."
d2292732,October 2022,50,The best dining experience I’ve ever had.,"We were able to get a table last minute and it was SO Worth it. The food was the best I’ve ever had in my life. So flavorful and so many choices. Great ambiance, great service and Max was so sweet and appreciative. We truly didn’t want to leave. You won’t be disappointed."
d2292732,September 2022,20,Meh,We were looking for a place to eat while it was raining. Table for two. We had no reservation and the first thing staff said to us we had to leave in an hour... then they didnt take our order for about 35 mins. We ordered the taster platter for two. The food was mediocre and it turned out there were plenty tables free even by the time we were meant to leave. The bill was incredibly high and they even wanted to try and charge us more. Cannot recommend at all. Small space and therefore very noisy as too many tables are crammed in.
d2292732,September 2022,50,Fabulous Indonesian Restaurant!,What a treasure! Impeccable food and service!! We tried it all and loved everything even my usually picky husband!! Make sure to make a reservation or get there early in case of a cancellation! One of the BEST restaurants in Amsterdam!
d2292732,September 2022,50,Fantastic restaurant and very nice atmosphere,"Ouaaaah ! Five stars restaurant, welcome, food, service. Our hotel INK booked a table for us telling that we would be very pleased. The space is friendly, the welcome is warm and the owner, Max, is a great, nice and very professional person. The food was just great and the service perfect. If you like Indonesian food, just book and go !"
d2292732,September 2022,40,Good modern asian food,We had the taster menu of which allergies were easily accomodated. The good is all of good quality and value. The place is very busy do reservations recommended.
d2292732,August 2022,20,"Poor experience, not real 'indonesian'","Horrible experience. The rijsttafel option is not real indonesian, but a look a like tourist dish. The next day after max we went to another (less touristy) place and there we experienced the REAL rijsttafel experience. Never again."
d2292732,August 2022,50,Innovative Indonesian cuisine in a friendly setting.,Innovative Indonesian cuisine in a friendly setting. Just west of Herengracht Canal and just east of Jordaan neighborhood.
d2292732,September 2022,40,Worth the flight from Canada !,"Excellent updated take on rystaffel . Fresh , beautifully presented . Vegetarian options Staff were wonderful. Definitely worth a visit ."
d2292732,August 2022,10,Would NOT recommend...,MAX restaurant is everything but a nice indonesian restuarant. The cooks are from turkey and the food is not authentic. It is overpriced in every way and the staff is rude. Avoid!
d2292732,September 2022,50,Wow. Just wow.,"I visited Max (again) with a mix of customers and colleagues. None had been to Max's restaurant before but every one of them loved it. The food (sublime), the service (exceptional) and the atmosphere (great fun and completely relaxed) made for a very, very special evening. Max and team, thank you, all of you. I have no doubt that you will be seeing some of those faces again."
d2292732,September 2022,50,Looking for delicious Indonesian - go to Max Amsterdam,"￼    Friends and I sought this restaurant out because of the great reviews from past patrons. We made a reservation online before leaving Canada and I recommend you do the same so you're not disappointed because the restaurant is small. We were not disappointed! We had their signature meal, Rijsttafel, and every dish served was fabulous. If you choose to go here, and you should, it is a little hard to find. Their sign is only on the wall, nothing hanging over the entrance, and a folding table was leaning against and covering most of it. But it was worth the persistence."
d2072803,September 2022,50,Great food /friendly service AMAZING,"Great food , friendly customer service the chef was also paying attention what the tables were having , the owner came and looked after us and also the waitress Vanesa was so friendly  Really good meat soft and the chimichurri OMG , they didn’t have sangria but you can also make it your self with wi e and Fanta(not the same of course) but they were happy to give us ice and bigger glasses over all amazing"
d2072803,September 2022,50,Gorgeous meal in lovely area of Amsterdam,"My Partner and I came here for a meal while in Amsterdam after I found it was one of trip advisors top rated steak restaurants and it did not disappoint.    We were about 15/20 mins early for our booking but were seated no problem. The staff were very friendly and our waiter was more than happy to attempt in assisting us with ordering.    We received complimentary bread with garlic butter. We then both had 350grams of Argentinian steak which comes with your choice of sauce and baked potato or chips. We had a bottle of red wine too.    We had hoped to get a seat outside after our meal to finish our wine as it was extremely warm during our trip and the restaurant is small inside but there is limited seating outside. One of the waitresses did go to the effort of asking people sitting outside if they wanted to swap with us, sadly no one did but we appreciated the fact she tried!    I would definitely recommend this restaurant. This area of Amsterdam is lovely too with a few bars dotted around the canals and outside seating. It’s about a 10 minute walk from Amsterdam Central."
d2072803,August 2022,50,Simply great steaks,"Great atmosphere, really friendly helpful staff, and scrumptious steaks. When you simply need a good steak, Luna is the destination in Amsterdam. After lots of holiday food, a delicious steak and simple but tasty sides were just what we needed. I’m gluten free and the staff were helpful and accommodating, but not specified on the menu."
d2072803,July 2022,50,Possibly the best Steak Restaurant in Amsterdam.,"There are loads of places to get a steak in Amsterdam, but if you want to avoid the chain Restaurants and go somewhere more personal, where they care about the food and wine they are serving, you cannot beat this place. And it's amazing value.  we had a tasting plate, of four steaks from around the world and it was an excellent education for me and my steak loving son.  (If you want the best steak here, and don't want to try them all, go for South American. Just lovely.  My only slight negative was the chips/fries. Not great, rather dry but made up for by the excellent wines.  Do not hesitate. Go here, if you can get a table."
d2072803,July 2022,50,Fantastic,"Fantastic sausages and steaks, quite a bargain. The staff were very friendly and gave us a table although we didn't make a reservation in advance. We will definitely come back."
d2072803,July 2022,50,Fantastic food and experience!,"A must visit whilst in Amsterdam - I chose to dine at this restaurant on the last day of my trip and I wasn't disappointed. The restaurant is based in a quiet side street, and has a great atmosphere. I asked the waitress for recommendations and she was helpful and upbeat. The food itself was delicious and I would highly recommend you visit this restaurant."
d2072803,February 2022,50,Wonderful food and great staff!,Great food and wonderful atmosphere! Perfectly prepared meat and beautiful presentation on a small grill on your own table. They have great wines and very tasteful desserts! The staff is very friendly and helpful. A wonderful place to have a nice evening! I would definitely recommend!
d2072803,February 2022,50,Great food and atmosphere!,"Restaurant luna gave us an awesome evening! They have wonderful food, the meat is really tender and they serve it with a really tasteful chimichurri sauce! The fries and vegetables are perfect. One of us has a gluten intolerance and the staff was really helpful explaining what we could and couldn’t eat! And they have allot of gluten-free options! Great ambiance and food with live music and very friendly staff!"
d2072803,January 2022,50,Very good restaurant!!,"The food was very good, the staff friendly and the inn is nicely furnished. Gladly again. ........... ................"
d2072803,July 2021,50,great lunch,"I was here (only) for a empanadas lunch. Great taste! Great atmosphere, nice people, great wine. Brought me back to my visits to South America. Can’t wait to come back to taste the steaks for dinner."

d2072803,October 2020,50,Meat overdose,"Amazing place for delicious meat cravers,went for the mixed platter to try them all and it was exquisite! Definitely recommended,staff was so friendly and service was amazing"
d2072803,September 2020,50,Early dinner,"100% recommend! Omg by far my favorite restaurant of our Amsterdam trip. I had the Argentinian steak med/rare and my boyfriend had the Brazilian steak med/well done, both cooked beautifully, we arrived before it opened and didn't realize until we walked in, the owner made us feel comfortable and wouldn't let us leave and come back later, very welcoming. If we weren't leaving today I would come back for sure."
d2072803,September 2020,50,Amazing food and friendly staff,"Amazing food and friendly service. Went with the 4 regional steaks and each where fantastic, delicious and high quality. The food is very reasonable and one of the best steaks I’ve ever had. Highly recommended and will return next time I’m back"
d2265132,October 2022,40,Delicious hamburgers,"Visited in Lombardos and had a hamburger with fries and a can of coke. The whole portion was delicisious and worth of money, really! There is under ten place to sit so quite many of the customers is having a take a way, I think."
d2265132,October 2022,50,Best burger in Ámsterdam,Attendant was very kind and have me good hints about the menu. The burger was really fantastic... The best one in Ámsterdam
d2265132,September 2022,10,Excellent burgers but the manager (?) is a rude arrogant cnt,"Absolutely amazing burgers, really high quality, and very creative, too. The staff, in general, are also very friendly, with some very noticeable exceptions. But communication with customers is a disaster. When orders online are made, there's a 50% risk you will never get your food, and they will not even inform you. When informed about anything not working / problems, they are never interested in using the feedback and repairing anything, their attitude is ""yeah, yeah, *** you, we have a lot of traffic anyway"". The last straw: I and many other people couldn't reach them by phone for over a month; I try to help companies I like to get better, and solve their issues - I called the owner/manager/business contact. There were basically two types of reactions possible: either getting concerned by the fact nobody out of dozen people couldn't reach them - or showing how much they did not give a ***. They chose the latter, and in the rudest way possible. Even though I explained clearly and politely why and with what problem I called, the person on the other end kept asking impatiently ""why are you calling me?!"" - and then just hung up. I am absolutely disgusted with this sort of behaviour. As much as I love their burgers, this attitude is absolutely outrageous. I have brought them over a dozen of new customers. Now I am going to warn them - like I warn you - how Lombardo's manages problem reports. There is also an absurdly humoristic accent to it: when I told the person I was about to publish an appropriate review, he wrote ""I don't want your review"" and called me ""super rude""! :D Did he authentically think this would convince me not to publish?"
d2265132,August 2022,50,"Excellent experience, amazing burger","Extremely friendly staff, amazing service. I am mostly impressed with the “El Chapo” burger and the overall efficiency of the experience. We were absolutely starving and the food was not only quick, it was also delicious. Will definitely come back here when in Amsterdam!"
d2265132,June 2022,50,Juicy lunch,"I love its juicy sandwiches. It's perfect. You should try it after some hours of work, as a lunch. I also like the location of the shop. It has lots of amazing markets."
d2265132,March 2022,40,The place and atmosphere are very unique- so it is part of the specialty...,"The facilities inside the restaurant are very modest. The room and space are very limited and the menue is outside ( why??!)    The burger was very good!, but the dish comes with nothing on the side.... if I was very hungry It wouldn't be enough for me...."
d2265132,March 2022,50,One of the best burgers!,Came across this place by chance and the decision to go inside proved to be the right one.  I had one of the best burgers I’ve ever had to the sound of a really funky soundtrack.  Would love to come back!  Only problem for me is that it doesn’t have a toilet!
d2265132,December 2021,20,Not recommend,"Food has no taste Burgers are very dry I ordered cheesiest burger that they had There was almost no cheese Chicken sandwich with cheapest chicken part , looks not tasty at all , we even decided to not try it Disappointed Not recommend"
d2265132,November 2021,50,10/10,Top 3 burgers I’ve ever had. Fantastic quality and presentation. I had the wagyu burger which was €20 and my partner got a basic classic burger for €10
d2265132,September 2021,50,Superb,"One of the best burgers i have had in Europe, top that with an extremely welcoming staff and that is the recipe for a superb place to visit. Thanks to Mr.Andrew, i hope to revisit the place in my next visit."
d2265132,August 2021,50,Excellent,"One of the best hamburger that I had in all my life, waiters are very friendly, service very quick and portions are very generous."
d2265132,September 2020,50,Best meal we've had so far in Amsterdam,"We don't eat meat very often, so when we do, we are pretty fussy about it. All the meat on Lombardo's menu is grass fed/free range and marinated and grilled to perfection!    My husband had the classic lamb burger and claims it to be the best burger he has ever had. The smashed potatoes were so buttery and flavourful, soft and fluffy on the inside, slightly crisp on the outside... Just amazing."
d2265132,July 2020,50,Crazy Delicious,"Best burger I had in a long time. They offer a variety of fricking delicious burgers. Price is fine, staff is friendly. Must Go!"
d2265132,June 2020,50,By miles away the best burger,"By miles away the best burger in town, never disappointed, great people, great food. Must do when here. 👌👌👌"
d2265132,December 2019,50,Great burger by global standards,"When I went to Lombardo’s I had been living in West Africa for more than a year. And that’s not a great region for burgers. The burgers at Lombardo’s are excellent. I especially like the USA Wagyu and the El Chapo Cartel Burger. The Wagyu really emphasizes the flavor of the beef. The El Chapo is like a symphony of flavor. The jalapeño, the avocado, the horse radish sauce, the cheese...it all goes together so well. These people are burger craftsmen."
d2006595,November 2022,50,Best steak in Amsterdam,"Best steak tried in Amsterdam, very juicy meet and rich flavor. Friendly staffs offer nice service as well. Highly recommended."
d2006595,November 2022,50,Delicious!,Cute place! GREAT SERVICE! Kelly was great & the chef ANGIE cooked my steak & asparagus to perfection! & the drink was delicious! 11/10 would recommend to anyone visiting amsterdam!!!!! So glad I found this place ! 😊
d2006595,November 2022,50,Amazing visit!,Stefanos made our experience so warming and welcoming. We look forward to going back again this week and hopefully being served by him! The chef Augie who cooked our meal did everything perfectly. Can definitely recommend! (Apologies if the names are spelt wrong)
d2006595,November 2022,50,Another great night at The Midtown Grill,"We have been to the Midtown Grill in the past and certainly will go again when the opportunity arises. All the food was excellent and carefully prepared and served. Our server Claudia was helpful, friendly and made sure we were all happy with our choices. The kitchen under her colleague Leonardo made sure everything was tasty and prepared to our liking. For a great night out or even to experience the classic steakhouse the Midtown Grill is ideal."
d2006595,November 2022,50,Dinner at Midtown Grill,"The food was great and Stefano was a delight. The steaks were the best part of the meal. Especially the aged ribeye. The carpaccio is also a must order Lovely evening dinner, highly recommended."
d2006595,November 2022,50,Great service by Claudia and Liza.,Service was very good. Friendly and helpful. Food was very well prepared by Lucas. Always a pleasure to enjoy when in town.

d2006595,November 2022,50,Amazing Steak Dinner,"Just had an amazing steak dinner with my husband. Our waiters, Stefanos, Kelly, and Sayat were amazing. They explained the various options and were always quick to clear table or bring more water etc. The food was delicious!! Steak was perfectly cooked, sides were great, and overall experience was perfect for a date night. Would highly recommend!"
d2006595,November 2022,50,Definitely worth visiting for dinner in Amsterdam,"What a lovely place for dinner in Amsterdam.    Located right in the centre, you really feel as if you are a part of the city, but also able to look onto it from a very chilled environment.    According to my wife(!), the steaks are great, but as I am a vegan I'll take her word for it!    Anyway, Sayat, Kelly & Stefanos still managed to look after my awkward dietary requirements, and made sure that I still had some amazing food.    Thanks, and hopefully we'll be back tonight if we can get a table!"
d2006595,November 2022,50,Overal perfect!,"Perfect service! Sayat & Stefanos welcomed us with open arms, they explained everything so well and have a true passion for their job! The food was also to die for! Definitely recommend"
d2006595,November 2022,50,Best service and steak,Our server Stefanos was excellent and gave us the best dinning experience ever from start to finish. The Tomahawk was to die for. Highly recommended.
d2006595,November 2022,50,Meal out,We had a fabulous meal at Midtown Grill. The steak was unreal (I had rib eye and my husband had fillet mignon) and our server Orhan was very attentive and friendly. Highly recommend for a nice meal out when in Amsterdam.
d2006595,November 2022,50,Great food and service,Amazing steaks including grassfed! Relaxed vibe and outstanding service from the whole team and especially our waiter Sayat! Thx we’ll be back
d2006595,November 2022,50,Amazing time!,"Had an amazing experience at midtown grill. 100% recommend, steak was cooked to perfection by chef Gabriel and Luca. Thank you to Stefanos and simos for the brilliant service!"
d4203545,October 2022,50,Eat here!!!,One of the most authentic tasting meals I have ever had! The gentleman would almost get excited explaining the dishes and it did not disappoint. This is a true Italian restaurant. You would walk right by it if you didn’t know about it. Noodles are scratch made! Do not skip this place! Excellent service as well!
d4203545,July 2022,50,ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING,"A great meal So good Risotto with langoustines ,courgettes and pine nuts Followed by the most wonderful semifreddo Nd the obligatory grappa Magnificent Thanks Fabio"
d4203545,July 2022,50,Great Restaurant - Highly Recommended,"Visited this restaurant twice during a five day stay in Amsterdam as it was so good. Really delicious food and wine, great value for money and excellent service. The pasta is amazing and so are the pizzas."
d4203545,July 2022,50,Lovely Italian,Lovely Italian with a great selection of handmade dishes. We had gluten free needs and the gluten free pasta was good (no GF pizza though). Very friendly staff who were working so hard
d4203545,July 2022,50,good food good people,"Very good pizza, very tasty e il Personale súper amable! Sicuramnte torneremo! Дуже смачна піца нам сподобалось"
d4203545,June 2022,50,A little piece of Italy in Amsterdam,Found through Trip advisor and we were not disappointed. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was great and the food brilliant. The only down side for us was that there were not open Monday or Tuesday otherwise we would have gone back.
d4203545,June 2022,50,Great find!,"Manages to get a cancellation while in Amsterdam with family. Great pizza, super carpaccio and lovely pasta. House wine at EUR4 a glass was delicious - highly recommended if you can get a table!"
d4203545,May 2022,50,realy cozy,"The restaurant „Eatmosfera“ proclaims to be real authentic italian kitchen, and it sure is. The menu is well balanced & offers a great selection of white & red wines but you can find different meals of the day as well.    The pizza had a light & fluffy dough & came with fresh & tasteful ingredients, pretty much like the ones you get in naples, italy. The seafood pasta was super fresh as well & the tiramisu was the best we‘ve ever had.    The personell was kind hearted & professional so no order, even the obligatory extra parmesan cheese, would be lost – all in all 5 / 5 stars and a sureshot for a cozy dinner night & a well executed italian kitchen experience."
d4203545,May 2022,10,We had to get shwarma after,"We arrived right on time for our reservation but, we had to wait for them to make space. Pasta was cooked well, good portion but all 3 pasta was oversalted. Lamb rack was awful, overcooked and it smelled of fish. Also the menü on t.a. is not being uploaded. Restaurant itself is crammed, not very athmospheric. Wouldnt suggest anyone, not great experience."
d4203545,April 2022,50,Ladies night,"A movie and a dinner was the plan and we felt like Italian. The ambient was cozy and intimate, the service pleasant and helpful. Their pizza chef was not working so we could only order the pasta but let me tell you, that proved to be the best thing ever. Usually pasta always disappoints me at a restaurant but these dishes were so good that we finished every last bit off the plate. Their pasta is homemade and delicious. Definitely going back!"
d4203545,March 2022,40,Good food - very nice service,"We went to the restaurant with some friends, that is very well located. We all took pizzas which were very nice, even though some of them were supposed to have truffle pesto and were served without. But the waiter was super nice and offered us one of the pizzas and tried to find solutions. I will come back!"
d4203545,February 2022,50,Evening meal in Amsterdam,"Eatmosfera, Excellent service, Excellent meals, the Ravioli was superb.reasonbly priced,a must visit"
d4203545,November 2021,10,Terrible place,"The place smelled awful, the service was horrible and the food was nothing special. I wouldn't recommend go there, we had a really bad experience!"
d4203545,September 2020,20,Oddest meal ever,Food was actually really nice but the service was atrocious. Also tried to charge me €20 more than was billed.
d4203545,May 2020,30,Pizza was really just ok.,Pizza was really just ok. Food was good but a far cry from the time I visited some time back. Could be do to delivery
d1503783,November 2022,50,"Amazing food, patient and kind staff","I got a amazing goat cheese and honey sandwich, delivery was quick, the vibe was comfortable and service was attentive. I forgot to pay and ran halfway down Amsterdam however they were very kind and thoughtful. Would highly recommend!"
d1503783,July 2022,40,Great place for lunch,"We loved this place! I had the mozzarella pesto baguette which was lovely, which was very large in size and came with a health portion of salad. Right by a canal as well, this was lovely!"
d1503783,June 2022,40,Nice Cafe,We had a nice breakfast here. Coffee was excellent! Breakfast sandwiches were very tasty. My favorite part was sitting outside while we ate. There is a great view of the canal and also excellent people watching with all the bikers heading to work.
d1503783,May 2022,50,"Fresh, flavourful, excellent price","Very fresh, full of flavour and friendly staff. Excellent price for the quality you receive. Was very impressed and we will 100% come back"
d1503783,October 2021,50,Late Breakfast,"A small but efficient place… the omelette was huge, and served on fresh roll with a nice fresh side salad; the goat cheese, walnut and honey dish was hot out of the oven and very good. Just a warning l, it’s cash only but there’s an ATM just up the block."
d1503783,September 2020,50,My favorite cafe,I have been to Amsterdam 4 times and this is my favorite lunch place. The grilled chicken sandwich is enough for two. They used to have homemade apple pie- delicious. The best casual lunch spot!
d1503783,September 2020,50,"Good Service, Good Prices.","Good Service, Good Prices. Better come Early. And you have to pay Cash. Can absolutely reccomend it. its a beatiful Place"
d1503783,June 2020,50,Grs V.,it's so simple and so delicious. very good price for the food offered by the friendly staff. also nice place. thank you !
d1503783,February 2020,50,Got lucky,"Just stumbled across this small cafe and thought would check out the food for a quick snack. Not much space but can eat in if a chair available or takeaway. I had a melted Brie sandwich and it was superb and served with a large salad side dish. Great food, great value, very filling and delicious. Good job."
d1503783,February 2020,50,Worth a visit!,"Every time I visit Amsterdam we visit broodjie berts at least twice and it’s always amazing food. Although it’s small inside, it’s worth the wait! The goats cheese and honey hazelnut dish is amazing!!"
d1503783,January 2020,50,Lovely small cafe with generous,Lovely small cafe with generous portions! Had the omelette which was delicious!! Cash only. Very relaxing to sit in warm cafe and watch the bikes roll by.
d1503783,September 2019,50,One of the best places to eat in,"Place with one of the most delicious food in Amsterdam. Portions are really big and delicious and the prises are not high. The location is very good - not far from centre with the view on the canal.  The only minus is that the restaurant is not very big, but it's not the big problem :)"
d1503783,October 2019,30,Food vs ATM,"The food was a good price for the value, however when it came time to pay they wanted only cash and since i didn't have any, they pointed to a nearby ATM in another shop, which by the way they own the ATM. Which means no where was it displayed on the ATM screen that they hit you with an extra 12% markup, so on my $200 euro withdrawal i paid $252 USD, doesn't sound too appetizing. I only noticed after i printed my ATM receipt and reviewed it after i had left the establishment.    I have a claim going on now with my bank, and i will let the Double Tree Hilton concierge know on how to advise their clients."
d1503783,October 2019,30,Food was good but final cost was questionable,"Upon ordering we were told they only take cash, they pointed to an ATM machine a couple of stores next door, which by the way they own the ATM machine.    The ATM machine did not show the conversion (euro to dollar) rate, once the transaction finished it showed a 12% markup on the conversion. I withdrew $200 euro and got charged $252 to my bank.    Seems to me they make more money referring people to the ATM vs what they make selling their food."
d1503783,October 2019,50,love this place,"Really good and affordable sandwiches!! Great choice of variety, very fast service. My favorite place for lunch!"
d12341057,October 2022,50,Must stop. Amazing potato melts in your mouth,"This was amazing. Melt in your mouth. Outstanding quality ingredients. After we ordered they brought it to our table at the Irish pub next. They were so nice, friendly and accommodating. So good. You have to stop. There may be lots of choices but this is a must stop For Something warm delicious and good value. I am going to need to get a second one it’s so good."
d12341057,July 2022,50,Best Baked Potato I've Ever Had,"Me and my partner came here for lunch the one day.    The jacket potatoes we had were huge, very well cooked and were amazing.  I had a basic potato with just some bacon bits on and it was still the best jacket potato I've ever had.  My partner had tuna and cheese, she also loved hers.    We will definitely come back the next time we're in Amsterdam."
d12341057,August 2022,50,Yum,Great and fast food. Potatoes are coming hot and delicious. Plenty of choices. Traditional Dutch potato was very tasty. Yummy😋
d12341057,September 2022,40,Good spot in the centre,"A very pleasant meal, we highly recommend the chicken salad for a fresh meal. The staff was very nice and friendly and the price is very accesible, for being in the center and in general. The average price per person is 15€."
d12341057,August 2022,40,Good food,Few tables. Better to have a reservation. Takes time to order and the order to arrive especially in the peak season. The food is however worth the wait
d12341057,July 2022,50,Baked potato,The best baked potato you’ll have in your life! Chili con carne with cheese was great. Wife ordered traditional beef stew and was also fantastic (very tender).
d12341057,July 2022,40,Worth a visit if you’re hankering for a baked potato,"Very tasty, reasonably priced and relaxed vibe. The half potato was more than enough for me and the whole potato looked gigantic - definitely a full meal. The menu isn’t super expansive but it’s big enough to have a few great options or just plain and build your own toppings."
d12341057,June 2022,50,Amazing place. Best potato.,5/5. Amazing place. Came across it by chance and it is the best potato ever!!!! Would defo recommend. The staff were really nice and friendly and the service was really efficient.
d12341057,March 2022,30,Must have corrected previous apparent staff issues...,"Our experience regarding the staff and service was excellent, unlike many reviews from late 2021. Decent enough food, but considering everything starts with a jacket (baked) potato, there should be an exhaustive menu of toppings from which to choose. There isn't."
d12341057,May 2022,40,"Beef stew on jacket potato was excellent, however service needs improved","The beef stew on the jacket potato was absolutely incredible. Alot of vegetables included too, all were really fresh and tasty. 4* mainly due to the service, it was clear that the waiter was alone and struggling to keep up with the service. Otherwise it would have been 5* for sure."
d12341057,November 2021,10,Unprofessional,"There was a sign that says to wait outside until they seat us, we waited outside for 10 mn in the cold while it was fairly uncrowded, employees would look at us from the window and then choose to ignore us, when I entered to ask about this, the host told to go wait outside in a condensing manner, met with this level of unprofessionalism, we had to leave"
d12341057,November 2021,10,Avoid eating there!!!!!,"Please don't waste your money and time eating here, very rude staff and mediocre food. You are better off spending your money elsewhere!"
d12341057,November 2021,10,Worst Customer Service and Food !,"This review is primarily regarding my disappointing customer service experience at Jacketz yesterday evening around 6pm. I felt compelled to provide you with this feedback as I think it is important that the management of this business intervene as the waiter was highly unprofessional which I suspect stems from the culture created by the staff.    When we arrived to Jacketz, he rudely and abruptly told us to wait outside when we opened the door even though the place was nearly empty with only a few customers, he could have easily requested us in a professional and welcoming tone to wait as he had to review our green pass which we had. He failed to act professionally and subsequently walked away and started to have a laugh with his colleagues and chatting away, whilst we were waiting outside for nearly 10 minutes, even the customers noticed we were waiting outside but despite this he continued to ignore our presence.    Finally, I opened the door and assertively asked him to seat us and gave him instantaneous feedback that we did not appreciate him enjoying a chat whilst we (customers) waited on the arrogant ""waiter"" who instead of apologising, attempted to become confrontational with us . The management of this organisation needs to conduct a performance review on this waiter and ensure that disciplinary action is taken accordingly.    We decided to leave due to his behaviour, it was very clear and obvious that the staff are strategically attempting to deter customers by being dismissive and ignoring them on arrival so they remain idle and have less work to do . You can read other google reviews made which had a similar experience, this business is losing money purely because of the staff who are treating customers with disrespect and unprofessionalism.    Management needs to review the culture and monitor the staff behaviour to keep their customers as the only remaining store in Amsterdam will probably be destined to fail if this continues."
d12341057,November 2021,10,Sub-standard customer service,"Really disappointed with the customer service at Jacketz ... I have been coming here for years (as a tourist.. Jacketz has always been a special place - great food, great ambience). However, I was shocked and saddened to see how the customer service has deteriorated since my last visit. The waiter first asked me to wait outside with an unwelcoming tone (it was a cold night) which I complied with. However, the waiter then proceeded to clean dishes and other non-urgent tasks and laughing with colleagues whilst customers were waiting outside for up to 10 minutes. This gave me a perception of a ""I don't care"" attitude which was so disappointing. I decided to leave as the waiter waiter continued to have a dismissive attitude. I've noticed that many of the Jacketz stores have sadly closed, and am starting to see why... if you treat customers with disrespect they will not return. I never thought I'd give Jacketz a 1 star review, but this will be my final time of visiting a Jacketz restaurant (I believe the last one) in Amsterdam - purely due to the lack of customer service. Management should really offer staff customer service training - a smile or some understanding goes a long way when dealing with your paying customers."
d12341057,September 2021,50,Alternative cuisine,Excellent jacket potatoes. Casual place with reasonable prices. Enjoyed the food and the wheat beer on tap. Was a nice change to other food we were eating on this trip. Do visit.
d8715527,July 2022,50,Great Brunch,We were lucky enough to find a table inside as it is a very popular little place. The service and atmosphere was great and friendly and the food as well as the freshly made lemonade and coffee was excellent. I went for the Legend and Mrs Jock The Classic. Perfect pitstop as we explored this wonderful city and totally understand why it is busy with locals and tourists alike.
d8715527,October 2022,50,Excellent stop for a quick snack or more.,"Lives up to its reputation. Best toastie ever. Staff are very friendly and being vegetarian, options are very good. Would recommend dropping by."
d8715527,September 2022,10,Appalling customer service,"I don’t normally write reviews but I really had to for this restaurant. We didn’t get to even try the food as we were waiting for a long time just to be served. Two other parties came in a lot later after us and even they got served first despite us getting the waitress attention multiple times. The waitress was so rude and didn’t even want to be there, and maybe she shouldn’t."
d8715527,June 2022,50,A Must Try :-),"Great food!!! The staff is so friendly and quick! We’ve come back 4-5 times and always enjoy the Ultimate Classic sandwich as well as their Yellow Juice. Highly recommend for a nice, healthy lunch! Definitely fills us up every time :)"
d8715527,June 2022,50,yummy breakfast in the heart of Amsterdam,"Looking for an early price-cheap healthy breakfast spot in Centraal, we came across toastable after a long time. It was the right decision, in good weather you can sit outside at a small table for two, or sit inside or have it delivered via various vendors.  Open every day from nine o'clock.  There are different toasted toast varieties that are generously topped from vegan, to chicken over vegetarian. 3 slices of toast on top of each other, either in wheat or dark. Prices per toast to max 10€ and you can be very well full after one toast. Everything tastes very real and full of flavor. I would say that it tastes good to everyone! Be sure to stop by there :-)"
d8715527,May 2022,40,Grilled Cheese Lovers Paradise.,Crowds are a good indication of a good place to eat and Toastables was crowded so we gave it a try. And it was a very good place to eat lunch. We had the best Grilled Cheese & Ham Sandwiches that were really big and really good. Service was very friendly and they still have a great playlist going on.
d8715527,April 2022,40,"Good food, nice atmosphere",Really tasty food. Great stop off for lunch and coffee. Chai coffee was yum. Service was good but not great. Few nice vegetarian and vegan options too Maybe wouldn’t want to be in a rush but would still recommend
d8715527,April 2022,40,Service with a smile!,Friendly service and tasty food! A great morning stop off before exploring Amsterdam. The ham and cheese croissants and Fajita toastie were just what we needed!
d8715527,February 2022,40,Great fast food!,"Delicious, quick and the perfect option for lunch on-the-go. The menu has a good selection of Toasties for everyones taste. It's a cheap, filling lunch. Well worth a visit."
d8715527,November 2021,50,Delicious toasties,"I’ve been to Toastable several times now, and it’s always great. Really tasty toasties with a generous amount of fillings inside. Definitely recommend!"
d8715527,November 2021,50,Good & fast breakfast,"Great juices, staff is friendly and obviously very good toasts. Also good Espresso. I had the classic breakfast toast."
d8715527,October 2021,50,Nice place for breakfast/brunch,"We actually had other breakfast planned the day we wondered to Toastable, because the first place we went to was closed, and the next had really long waiting line and since we were really hungry we decided just to sit down at the next restaurant that had table available.  Bringing us to Toastable.  Cozy, little place that have great variations in their breakfast menu. Ordered myself a croissant with tomatoes, cheese and holy guacamole, freshly squished juice and a latte. Everything was really tasty. My partner had a chicken sandwich with curry dressing. Do recommend both."
d8715527,September 2021,50,Amazing Food & Service,"The food and service is amazing! I highly recommend this place + amazing an music playlist, if you’re in town and looking for a place, this is it."
d8715527,February 2020,50,The best toastie I have ever had!,"Wow.  This place was just the best find on a very wet and horrible dreary day in amsterdam!  The place was busy but we managed to get a seat right at the back!  To be fair, I love a good cheese toastie but didnt really expect what I actually got!  This was honestly the best cheese toastie I have ever had!  My partner also really loved hers!  It is just a cheese lovers heaven!  If I am ever up this way in amsterdam again then I will be sure to visit!  I have tried to recreate it myself at home and failed miserably so will just have to fly over for another!  Thank you!"
d8715527,August 2020,50,Great variety of food ! Toast,Great variety of food ! Toast full of cheese and additional things that you can choose with nice menu. Coffee great too ! Highly recommended for good start of the day in Amsterdam.
d3657552,October 2022,50,An absolute must visit!,"Jon and the team are absolutely incredible. The cocktails are top notch. If you can’t decide from the large menu they will ask you a few questions and mix you a custom cocktail. The General Lee was fantastic.    Believe it or not the best part of T&S is not the cocktails. Instead, it’s the incredible atmosphere and the BEST service and conversation with the staff you could ask for.    This was my first time in Amsterdam and I will be visiting T&S as my first stop next time I am here. I am on my way to visit for the 3rd day in a row. T&S has been the highlight of my time thus far and it will be hard to top it.    If you are looking for an 11/10 cocktail and want to enjoy some incredible company, sit at the bar and let Jon take care of you."
d3657552,September 2022,40,Great place but very disappointing last visit!,"My girlfriend and I really like the vibe of this place and the cocktails are by far one of the best in Amsterdam. It is truly a shame that on our last visit we waited outside for a while and then were led to the bar to have a drink until a free spot became available. Although sipping at cocktails while standing by the bar and taking in the bustling atmosphere has its charm, this was no short wait.. Much to our surprise, we then realised that the person who had been waiting behind us in the line (and was clearly on friendly terms with all the staff members) had been given the only free table. So disappointing to see that! It ruined our experience so we headed for the exit doors after a round. We will come back as the place is great and these unprofessional blips will not discourage us:)"
d3657552,September 2022,50,Definitely stop for a cocktail,Amazing cocktails and super friendly staff. Atmosphere was perfect! Hip speakeasy cocktail bar with a fab vibe. Eclectic. Cozy.
d3657552,August 2022,50,My liver is glad they are not open 7 days a week,"Great cocktails, great staff from the gentleman. At the door. Loved everything we had there. One of the few places we will keep coming back to when in Amsterdam"
d3657552,August 2022,50,Great cocktails,Great cocktail bar make their own creations which are lovely but also mix whatever your favourite cocktail is and mix it well. I had two from the menu and a mojito my wife had the same with a Bloody Mary extra spicy . We had a bar snack which was nice but I’d caution this is not a Restraunt. It’s not cheap but by city centre prices I didn’t think it expensive either. The decor is classy and the ambience really cool. The staff were ver friendly and good fun. Couldn’t get in on the Friday ( they control entry to keep the ambience) . Went at 5:30 on the Saturday. Adult bar for adults to enjoy a drink! Recommended
d3657552,July 2022,50,This place deserve some of your time !,"Positively surprised at any point.  This place is great ! Looking good, cosy and chill with a old whiskey bar vibe.  All the staff is warmly welcoming you, always ready to discuss and feed you with all the positivity you need.  The cocktails are great and thanks to the attention to details that the staff is having, they are making them evolve to reach your taste during the time you are here (of course you need to take more than one, but it's totally worth it !).  Clearly a place i will now visit everytime im coming around !"
d3657552,July 2022,50,Fabulous cocktails!,Really enjoyed our experience in this lovely cocktail bar. The menu is really thought out and the staff are super helpful. Lovely touch that they give a bottle of water along with each drink. Thank you and will return!
d3657552,July 2022,50,A must visit!,"Visited Tales & Spirit following a recommendation from a friend and it did not disappoint. What a fantastic experience. We arrived as soon as it opened on the Saturday and opted for a window table. The bar gets busy quick, so recommend getting there early. The cocktails are unique and some even have their own theatrics. We recommend ‘Zombie’ for a memorable moment. Also recommend getting some bitter ballen as it’s the best we’ve ever had!    Can’t wait to visit again next time we are in Amsterdam."
d3657552,May 2022,50,Best cocktails in town,"The best cocktails in town. Great staff, food is good and clientele is polite and friendly.  John, the bartender, listens carefully to your requests and serves you like a champion.  Alessandro, the waiter, loves to mele sure you’re comfortable and happy.  Can you ask for more?"
d3657552,April 2022,50,Good Recommendation,Our 30 something year old son suggested we 50 year olds go check out this cool small bar. We were skeptical but pleasantly surprised. We really lucked into a 4 top because it is very busy. They ask for your coats as you walk in because they are very strict about no drugs being brought into their establishment. We were fine with it and felt very comfortable even though we were the old peeps in the bar. Fun place with great atmosphere and the drinks were amazing. Would suggest checking it out. Go early...
d3657552,February 2022,10,Disappointed,"An absolute disappointment. After reading the good reviews we had high expectations. At the door we were asked for our QR codes, which we showed. Then we also had to show our ID. My wife couldn’t show hers and we were refused to get in. Showing bank pass wasn’t enough. The worst thing was that the guy at the door treated us very unfriendly and rude and was not prepared to help. The place was nearly empty, so I don’t understand why they didn’t want our business. According to the door man masks were not required, so they were no very consequent. NEVER AGAIN!"
d3657552,September 2020,50,Our new favorite spot. Outstanding,Our new favorite spot. Outstanding and creative cocktails. Great vibe. Friendly and attentive service (even outside). The mixologist will come talk to you about what he created (he didn’t let us down once!). Make a reservation though (due to covid). Not cheap but worth it. You won’t regret the experience.
d3657552,August 2020,50,My favourite bar in Amsterdam!,"My favourite bar in Amsterdam!    I have been here twice now and both times have had an amazing experience. The service is impeccable, you can see the staff love their job, the cocktails are amazing and very fairly priced!    Make sure you make a reservation though!  I booked this for my boyfriends birthday, we had Jan (sorry if i misspelt your name!) who served our drinks, he was honestly amazing, so friendly and with a great humour. Make sure you try the Zombie!"
d3657552,August 2020,30,Unexpected surprise!,The staff was very friendly and helpful with the choice of cocktails. The menu present quite a lot and intresting cocktails; I personally chose the Eureka which was served literally in a bulb with a small light inside. Brilliant Idea! The place is quite small so I would advise to book in advance if you are a large group.
d3657552,December 2019,40,Not too shabby,"Friendly, efficient, knowledgeable staff (though they made a few mistakes on their history!) serving well presented, flavoursome cocktails. The barman made me his interpretation of a Manhattan, which was slightly in the sweet side, but absolutely delicious! One of the better bars in the city."
d1776852,November 2022,50,Amazing food and friendly service :),"My friend and I visited Krua Thai last week whilst on holiday in Amsterdam - and it was a wonderful experience from start to finish :) We hadn't booked so turned up hoping there would be room and the staff were so lovely and accommodating, they found us a table right away which had an hour limit on it due to a later reservation which we didn't mind at all.    We are both vegan, which was absolutely no problem and we had the leaves as the starter (they are unreal you have to try them!) and two tofu and vegetable curries for main which were also delicious. All the staff were so friendly and smiley and really kind, we had the best time and were really well looked after. I'd definitely love to come back one day!"
d1776852,November 2022,50,Best Thai food and staff in town,Here you can get amazing Thai food for a reasonable price. Friendly and competent staff. They have a special gluten free waiter that can help you through the menu
d1776852,October 2022,40,Piece of Thailand,"Walked by and  managed to get a table for two (not possible to reserve in a net, fully-booked). Lovely food, owner joking, the whole stuff busy and smiling.  The lady serving our table recommended for a start (one of them) the portion ”herbs on a pepper leaf’; would never tasted it otherwize but that was something took it next evening as well!  If returning to Dam either with friends of a teenged son, we’ll make a reservation to make to get here again. Piece of Thailandaroi maak"
d1776852,October 2022,50,Fantastic celebration meal,"We visited this brilliant restaurant on a busy Sunday evening. They were fully booked but found us a table, very kind of them. The service was first class, they recommended some lovely dishes, and were super helpful, 10/10"
d1776852,October 2022,50,"Excellent, excellent food",The best Thai restaurant I have ever been to. I had a firm idea about what I wanted to order but I let myself be guided by the owner and didn’t regret it. Amazing food!
d1776852,October 2022,50,Small place but nice meals.,Small place but nice meals. Very delicious. Everything we ordered was nice . Make reservation before going.
d1776852,October 2022,50,Amazing thaï restaurant !!,"We had an amazing time in this restaurant ! We passed by it and thought it looked amazing, but they were fully booked, so had to book for the next day : it was worth it ! Such flavors, generous portions, and a good vegetarian selection. The staff was so sweet, explaining the dishes and checking on us frequently. Service was very quick as well, which is great when you’re hungry ! The chef even came over to the tables to chat with all the customers. Wonderful food, wonderful team, you should definitely book a table when in Amsterdam."
d1776852,June 2022,50,Fantastic Food and Service,"We were lucky to get a table without booking, although we were given a time limit and the restaurant was packed.  The food was amazing, possibly the best Thai food we've eaten and we have eaten Thai cuisine all over the world, including in Thailand itself!  The service was excellent - so friendly even though the restaurant was incredibly busy with excellent suggestions and recommendations.  Highly recommend!"
d1776852,August 2022,50,Best Thai restaurant,"Just book it - tasty Thai food, great for vegetarian options. Loved the spring rolls and mango sticky rice for dessert! Really friendly staff, highly recommend. Book in advance to get a table inside!"
d1776852,August 2022,30,Dictated tipping,"Food was great, could've been 5 stars easily because we really had a great evening.    BUT our (up-untill-the-bill-came) charming waitress decided to coerce us into tipping more. We added like 4 euros and she replied that usually guests tip 10%. Welp we were stupid enough to add a few euros.    We decided to substract that tip from our rating on here, so there you go."
d1776852,August 2022,50,"Super friendly, great food","Not a single negative thing to say about this restaurant.  The staff were all genuinely enthusiastic about making our experience as enjoyable as possible, guiding our choices, explaining the meals and checking that everything was going well. Their recommendations were spot on and delicious.  A great evening."
d1776852,August 2022,50,Great thai,"Top recommendation from us even though they forgot our order so we had to wait a while. The food was perfect, the waiters were really kind, and a nice atmosphere."
d1776852,July 2022,50,Amazing Thai Food!,"Really need to leave this review for this restaurant because the food, the service, the attention was just amazing!  In Amsterdam only 2 nights with my partner and because I absolutely adore Thai food, I absolutely had to eat Thai one night! This restaurant did not disappoint. It’s definitely ‘up there’ with the best I’ve had!  The friendly owner worked his tables well making sure everyone was happy. The staff were attentive & always smiley. It’s a small (approx. 20 tables) cosy restaurant with some tables outside too.  We will def be back when we visit again. THANK YOU!"
d1776852,July 2022,50,Recommended to us - and well worth the visit.,"We had looked in TA for Thai restaurants in Amsterdam and saw Krua Thai but when it was independently recommended by our hotel concierge, we knew it would be good. The service was brilliant - warm, welcoming and attentive. The food was delicious - so tasty and fresh, and served quickly. Wine selections were really well paired to the food - I love a vinho verde! The atmosphere was relaxed and really enjoyable and you could sit outside (although we chose inside as was a bit chilly).  Would highly recommend this restaurant (and the people - so lovely!)."
d1776852,July 2022,50,Amazing food that you simply have to experience !,"We arrived in Amsterdam and by accident ended up eating in Krua Thai Classic, what a wonderful accident it ended up being! We both love Thai food and have visited Thailand many times but never have we experienced such amazing dishes that we were served at Krua Thai Classic. The owner took time to understand what we liked and suggested specific dishes from the menu that we would never have chosen ourselves. The starter we shared was Meang Kham ; an explosion of flavours in your mouth! Ive never tasted anything like it! You must try it if you go.  Our main courses didnt disappoint either, such wonderful food  I would definitely recommend that you visit . Such an great experience  Fabulous friendly service , amazing food and great prices  A must!  Kate and Ian"
d1229275,September 2022,50,"First class food, great service","Great food, Italian excellence all the way through. Service friendly and helpful and wine suggestion really made it a pleasant evening."
d1229275,July 2022,50,Ideal Italian.,We had a lovely birthday dinner for my husband here. The food was delicious and the staff were very attentive. Our meals were brought to us in good timing and the meals were explained perfectly as delivered . I’d happily return here…if I were to...More
d1229275,June 2022,50,Delighful Evening,"We discovered this treasure based on a reccommendation from our hotel. We had the 5 course dinner and were not disappointed. All courses were well prepared and very tasty. The waitstaff was attenive and very helpful, suggesting a great wine for our dinner. A great restaurant in the 9 Streets area."
d1229275,June 2022,40,Charming place. Meal does not worth it.Bread fantastic.,"We love the atmosphere of the place. The service is absolutely excellent and helpful. But the evening menu is highly concise. There is no variety. The risotto is delicious. The eggplants are not so much and are highly salted. The beef is mediocre. The bread is fantastic. The focaccia is very salty as well. In my opinion, the place is charming, but given the cost of the dishes, the food could be better."
d1229275,May 2022,50,Incredible Degustazione meal!,"Just around the corner from The Hotel Pulitzer is this quaint cafe! We chose the Chef's 5 course dinner! Great cocktails- I had an Aperol spritzer! From the fresh bread baked on premises that we could not stop eating to the Beetroot salad, quail, ravioli with lamb and I chose the fish and my husband had the beef entrecote topped off by a pineapple tart with bourbon ice cream! Every dish was expertly and creatively prepared! Great staff all around ! A true gem!"
d1229275,May 2022,50,Excellent,Exceptional. Always great. The pasta is something else and the ambiance and service are great. Very reasonable value for the money
d1229275,May 2022,50,World class restaurant,"This small and elegant restaurant was an amazing find. Every bit as good as all the reviews state, the food here is amazing. This would be a five-star restaurant in Manhattan. Service is impeccable, food wonderful. Highly, highly recommend."
d1229275,March 2022,50,Really Lovely Lunch!,"We booked lunch for four last weekend. The welcome was friendly and we were quickly seated on a big round table.  The lunch menu gave us lots of choice and we ordered a bottle of rosé.  The wine was lovely.  The main courses we had consisted of salads, sandwiches and a ravioli dish. All were excellent, as was the coffee.  All in all a great lunch with excellent service from a waiter who gave a great description of the wine and food.  Definitely worth a visit and we shall be back for dinner in the future."
d1229275,March 2022,50,Wonderful tasting menu and stellar service,"We happened upon Bussia on a 20 hour layover, while walking the canals. The space was beautiful and we peeked in to see if it was possible to seat us for dinner. Paulo hesitated and then said, “Let me see if I can work some magic.”    Paulo produced magic and the team at Bussia presented a 5 course tasting menu and wine pairing that will not be forgotten. They had no idea this was our 25th wedding anniversary dinner and they couldn’t have been more generous, hospitable and gracious. Paulo was generous with his descriptions and answers about our wine pairings and I would have thought him to be the Somm.    We’ve had the pleasure of dining in some amazing locales and experiencing some of the best menus and Bussia has made our top 10 list, alongside places like Moments in Barcelona, Junebaby in Seattle and The Willows on Lummi Island.    We will look forward to the day we can join them again. Until then, continue to make magic happen!"
d1229275,March 2022,50,Buono e gustoso,"The menu is not very extensive, but there is still enough choice for everyone. Opted for the Menu Degustazione: a selection of the a la carte dishes. A short summary: beautifully laid out plates, delicious high-quality dishes and extremely friendly service. Don't hesitate, go there if you enjoy good cuisine."
d1229275,February 2022,50,Real Italian breakfast!,"We tried pastries, coffee and cappuccino - everything was great! A real Italian delight in the heart of Amsterdam. Incredibly kind and welcoming waiters and also lovely place, we'll be back for sure."
d1229275,December 2021,30,Cafeteria style,Granted was warned the menu was limited on a Sunday lunch but one could be forgiven for thinking even on a normal day with the full menu on song that the atmosphere would be decidedly cafeteria style without any of the elegance that could be ascribed to an Italian eatery recommended as amongst the best in town !
d1229275,December 2021,30,So so,It’s definitely not a modernist cuisine. Pasta and pizza as in every regular Italian restaurant around your corner. It was good but not as expected
d1229275,October 2021,50,Excellent,"We were lucky to find this gem, and extremely lucky to have found it on Sunday... they do pizzas on Sunday. Loved their sourdough pizzas... unbelievably good. Even their pasta was tasty. And the desserts were really really special! A must try!!!"
d1229275,November 2021,50,Excellent,"Back after the pandemic— high quality food, exceptional service and overall very reasonable value for the money. Excellent"
d4328782,October 2022,50,World class,"Truly fine Indian. A nice welcoming comfortable dining experience in the centrum area. Reservations needed. Shrimp biryani well spiced with fresh prawns, classic yellow Dahl , perfect garlic nan and of course a mango chutney. World class!More"
d4328782,September 2022,50,Best Indian restaurant- hands down! Great ambiance and customer service,"Best indian restaurant I’ve ever been to!!! We are from the US and nothing beats the ambiance and the taste/quality of the food. The manager was so nice to accomdate us for a last minute booking and we couldnt have been more appreciative! Presentation, location,...More"
d4328782,October 2022,50,YOU NEED TO EAT HERE,"Stumbled upon this restaurant. It looked god from the outside once inside it looked spectacular. We had a table for two. The staff were so friendly, the whole atmosphere was perfect. The food came and was one of the best Indian/Nepalese restaurants we have been to. Highly recommend you to go."
d4328782,October 2022,50,Awesome food,"We came to this place upon Tripadvisor‘s rating. Even though they were booked out, they managed to find a nice table for us.  Everything was just perfect. From the service to the food to the atmosphere. We can highly recommend this place."
d4328782,September 2022,50,Best Butter Chicken Ever,We were recently in the central part of Amsterdam and near our hotel was the Ashoka restaurant that offers fine Indian and Nepalese cuisine. I can't tell you enough how we enjoyed their Indian butter chicken and the whole dining experience was wonderful. You can tell that the owner pays attention to the cuisine and the entire dining experience. The owner's Daughter took care of us and her aura was nothing but kindness and hopeful that we would have a great experience. I highly recommend this great restaurant.
d4328782,September 2022,50,Understated but top quality,"From the outside this looks a pleasant enough restaurant, but inside the quality of the food offer is top drawer. Popular with locals and visitors alike, this is a buzzy but unpretentious place with te emphasis on the food."
d4328782,September 2022,50,Loved the food!,Chicken & Veg Momos (Dumplings) the Non Veg Platter all were v tasty! Great ambience. Located within walking distance of Dam Square and Centraal.
d4328782,September 2022,50,Amazing food,This is the best Indian food I've had! The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside but is absolutely stunning and bigger then what you'd think. The service was brilliant and the food exceptional. A bit on the pricey side but well worth the money!!!
d4328782,September 2022,50,Amazing Indian food in Amsterdam,"They have a wide variety of Indian and Nepalese food with different chili degrees, all what we took upon the recommendation of the waiters were delicious. The service was distinguished, all the staff were very friendly and helpful"
d4328782,September 2022,50,Very cordial and friendly staff creating an excellent family dinner outing experience,Excellent authentic Indian and Nepalese food. Very cordial and friendly staff creating an excellent family dinner outing experience! Must try the Kokhura Ko Masu - the authentic Nepalese chicken and the Keema Naan - just wonderful!
d4328782,September 2022,50,"Found by coincidence, but great experience","Found by coincidence strolling through Amsterdam, it was a really pleasant experience. Very nice and delicious food, freshly made an very tasty. Very friendly staff and brilliant atmosphere. We’ll come back again."
d4328782,September 2022,50,Excellent!,"Delicious food, excellent service and very friendly staff! If you want a genuine and original taste of Indian/Nepal food, you should definitely come here!"
d4328782,September 2022,50,Amazing Ashoka,"Wow! What a beautifully crafted menu, with flavours to suit all. Had the Mixed Platter, and the combination of flavours worked so well as an Appetiser. Followed this with a taster of Lentil Dal, Vegetable Curry, and Chicken dish. Absolutely stunning! Had to taste the wifes Korma too. I can honestly say the best meal I have eaten of this cuisine!"
d4328782,August 2022,40,First time trying indian food in a restaurant,"I went here with my friend during our trip to Amsterdam, the place is beautiful, elegant and calm. We ordered chicken momo and paneer to start and then i had butter chicken with white rice plus a tandoori roti while my friend ordered lamb biryani. Everything was delicious, also must try the mango lassi very refreshing.  Service very attentive and professional.  Thank you!"
d4328782,August 2022,40,"Diner 2 times in 2,5 weeks",I went back for a second dinner in 2.5 weeks means that the first dinner impressed me and my family. The ambiance of this restaurant is great. The tables are not suitable for family size groups maybe some bigger tables can be added just dropping an idea.  Although in my opinion a very good place to dine I had a little less experience which I want to share. Yesterday I was there again and ordered the royal thali - it was a bit disappointment as I have different experience with thali's and if you order a royal Thali you expect something very special. My Thali meal was even forgotten and when brought also not complete.  Next to that we wanted to order Bhindi without masala which was not possible - from my view if the meal is prepared fresh a request to not add masala should not be an issue for a establishment like Ashoka. The waiter didn't even bother to ask the chef if it was possible.
d3323106,November 2022,50,"Great food, Great service","It was my first time at the seafood bar and the food was more than amazing. The restaurant is beautiful and has a nice atmosphere. I highly recommend the mixed grill so you get a taste of everything. We were served by Jeroen, simply the sweetest, and he really paid attention to us. We will definitely come back here!"
d3323106,November 2022,50,Best value of money,King prawn is the best Nice atmosphere Nice stuff Oysters are delicious! Very good location Good for couples Relaxed
d3323106,November 2022,10,Terrible service,"There are lots of servers running around the joint but when you call one of they they simply ignore you. They remove the plates from your table before you finish eating, without saying a word. It’s almost as if they didn’t want you there. Would not return ever again or recommend this place to anyone for that matter. No one came to take out order, tables that arrived after us were tended to before us. Incredibly overpriced and underwhelming."
d3323106,October 2022,50,Wonderful evening with friends,"……..We had a great evening with friends from abroad…,..a tremendous seafood platter to share and marvelous wine…….was not the first time ……..so we knew a little bit what to aspect…….our table-lady Julia for this night was exelent she realy gave our evening an extra dimension…..we’ll come again……….."
d3323106,October 2022,50,First time Seafoodbar: success,"As a non fish-eater, I had my doubts visiting the Seafood Bar, but since we've heard such great stories, we decided to give it a try. Our waitress Julia was very helpfull in selecting the right meal. In the end I had a wonderfull meal, with a great ambience."
d3323106,October 2022,50,Best fish in town!,"On recommendation we had a selection of fingerfood followed by the mixed grill. Really nice restaurant and atmosphere, quality food and great staff. Thanks again Julia for the great service and recommendations!"
d3323106,October 2022,50,Great service and food,Great experience! Amazing food and service! Especially Julia made us really feel welcome and served us with a smile. Would definitely come again.
d3323106,October 2022,50,Nice service Julia! and great food,"Thank you Julia for the recommendation for food, first time here and having a blast! Portion is big enough"
d3323106,October 2022,50,Great find.,"We ate here twice and enjoyed the food very much. Good atmosphere and friendly staff, the fish and chips were excellent as was the salad. The seafood platters looked amazing and were clearly very popular although we didn’t try them."
d3323106,October 2022,40,Fish it is!,"Since I love fish, we came here for the second time. The mixed grill was fantastic! We had another great evening. The restaurant is beautifully decorated, the wine matches the dishes and Julia's attentive service made it a fantastic evening. We will be back soon!"
d3323106,October 2022,50,UNBELIEVABLE!,Absolutely delicious! Gorgeous restaurant and very clean! We sat at the “bar” that overlooked the cook preparing salads with all the fresh seafoods! Very fresh! I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and it was well priced for what you get! We got the grilled octopus for starters and the mixed grill crustaceans!
d3323106,September 2022,50,Fruit de mer,"Really good restaurant. I came here with my girlfriend to eat the fruit de mer for two persons. All the fish was really tasty and fresh. The staff was really kind and experienced, Julia in special. She explained all the types of fish to us and she was really kind. Thank you Julia. We will tell friend about this nice restaurant!"
d3323106,October 2022,50,Great!,"Again we had a great time with our friends.  Julia was our host, most of the evening.  Great food (tuna tataar with avocado crème as a starter, was delicious) and very nice service.  How kind, Julia came at the table to goodbye when she left, after finishing her work, and while we had our coffee."
d3323106,September 2022,50,A great fish restaurant and very versatile,There are many seafood restaurants in Amsterdam but this one clearly stands out. We were served by a very friendly good looking charming young lady who seemed nothing too much I believe her name is Julia.    We started with the delicious Shrimp in herb butter from the oven and my wife the Dutch shrimp croquettes really perfect in taste.    Then we took the mixed grill a variety of delicious fish cooked to perfection.    This restaurant is highly recommended
d3323106,October 2022,50,Romantic dinner at the Seafood Bar in Amsterdam!,"Julia is a professional, kindness and attentive server! Thank you for pleasant evening with nice atmosphere and delicious fresh seafood!"
d6649841,October 2022,40,Unformal great placr for mossels and gin,"You need to like mossels and gin....but they do both super well....cocktails are great, mossels rather good. Service is excellent . One sad point....tables are very uncomfortable, too basic, uncomfy chairs...outside setting is on stones, table equipment is messy, a bit like a cantine...and that s fine, but it hardly matches a 8 euros gin...."
d6649841,September 2022,40,"Great mussels, wonderful gin cocktail if you can bear the blasting sound","After a visit to an art fair in the westergas park, on a horribly rainy night, I did not want to go far and tried this restaurant. The truffel mussels were fantastic, the gin cocktail a perfect accompaniment, and we get to take home our free tube of gin-mayo, a vegan mayonnaise (Don't ask what's in it!).  Had the weather been better I would have sat outside, but the blasting music was definitely reduced the appreciation of the meal.  I do not know why, restaurants believe that blasting decibels is necessary in a restaurant. As they say, there should be a law! Why don't they blast their sound system in one area, and at least leave another area without speakers, a little like the old smoking-no smoking sections. To be considered."
d6649841,April 2022,50,An excellent combination,"Not so far from the city center, we found that gem. The place was interesting, the service amazing and super friendly and the mussel pots delicious. Oh, I forgot the great Gin cocktails. It was definitely a dinner to remember!"
d6649841,April 2022,50,Great cafe in the park,Great seafood cafe inside the park. Everything is fresh there (what is most important for mussels and oysters for sure). Great gin drinks. And if it is especially sunny- you do not want to leave.
d6649841,October 2021,50,"Good Food, Good Location and Oh that Gin","Local restaurant with great mussels and frites, Try the gin mayo Don't miss the infused gin drinks--I had two"
d6649841,October 2021,50,Fun spot,Our drinks were delicious and the service great- unique drinks and our server was helpful in guiding us to good choices Westerpark is a great setting
d6649841,July 2020,40,2 things simply done very well!,"I have been to Mossel & Gin twice now and both times have been really nice. They only do two things, Mussels + Gin & Tonics, however they do them both REALLY well.    The new ordering / QR code system works nicely and everything arrives in quick time. The Gins are all wonderful, refreshing and different and there is enough variety of mussel flavors for everyone.    The Roquefort & truffle mussels are delicious however they can be very rich so it can be a struggle to eat them all as the portions are very generous here.    They play really good music so sitting outside on the terrace is recommended in the summer!"
d6649841,June 2020,10,there are no words to describe,"there are no words to describe this place a restaurant ... super expensive, we took two fried fish and some potatoes were fried three times full of oil and dried .... finally the mussels without flavor full of cooking cream and ginger .... the wine was water with sulphites but the wine did not exist all this 90 euro given away and everything remained on the table ....."
d6649841,February 2020,50,Innovating,"A really alternative place where to eat good food,well presented and with an amazing selection of gins...the gin mayo was superlative!! The two guys who own the place are simply awesome!looking forward to go back in Amsterdam"
d6649841,January 2020,50,Lovely lunch,Woww this is a awesome place! Love the spot middle of the Westerpark. The owner josh is so passionate about serving the ocean life. The mussels are the best I ever have tasted. We highly requirement mossel and gin!
d6649841,January 2020,50,Best nice funky mossels in town,Super cool nice hip please in the middle of the Westerpark. Lots of infused gin and different kinds of mossels. My fav is the Zeeuwse spek (bacon)!!😍
d6649841,January 2020,50,"Fantastic food, great service!","We made a booking online, then were greeted with unfortunate news - there was no space for us! For context, this was a friendly greeting from the owner, who offered us a free drink on the house and to sit outside under the heaters while we waited. This to me, is what fantastic service means. You can't always control things like how long previous customers remain in their seats, but you can compensate to make sure that problems are solved, which is exactly what happened.    Once we were seated, the place continued to impress. The food was spectacular, and their gins were equally delicious. The atmosphere was warm and simply stylish. This was one of my Amsterdam highlights, and deserves it's stellar reputation. I don't even like Mussels, and I'm now a convert! ^_^"
d6649841,November 2019,20,Plan in advance,"We were visiting Amsterdam and picked this out after some research into restaurants that would be ""different"" - and it is.  It serves seafood and specialises in gin, though some wine is available if you ask for it. However, the problem we found is that it is located in a park and when, at 8.00 p.m. we arrived at the entrance to the park in a taxi, we found the barrier closed. We had to walk through the park to the restaurant - which was not very comfortable - it was cold, damp, and the paths are poorly lit.  The restaurant had made a mess of my booking, but ""fortunately"" there was a spare table beside the bar. It was not very conducive to a relaxed meal, particularly as the tables are closely packed together and a diner at an adjoining table was accompanied by his dog - not a guide dog for someone who is visually impaired, but a large pet dog. This evidently is encouraged by the restaurant as the staff gave the dog a water bowl.  We had a quick snack and we fled.  If anyone wants to try this restaurant, I suggest that you either go in Summer when it's bright in the evenings, or go for lunch in the winter."
d6649841,November 2019,40,Cozy Cozy Cozy Gin Cozy,Nice agreeable perfect service and friendly environment great Gin choice and food great great I will return for sure!!
d6649841,October 2019,50,‘Musselman’ found his best shop!,"I was once called ‘mussel’ man by friend. I travelled the world and the Seven seas to taste yummy mussels . Been tasted mussels from Belgium, London, Tasmania, US, Asia....    This shops bought me absolute excitement!    They have apart from classic flavor, 5 other flavors  The black truffle is a must try !  Thai and mustard are great too !    I went in 3 days for my trip and tasted all 6 flavors    The owner Wouter is super friendly !    I got recommendation from a local Dutch colleague to this restaurant when I asked where to have mussels in Amsterdam  Bcoz I know even the ones served in Belgium are grown here    They are very tender and juicy  Unlike other species    Also worth mentioning is the potato chips to go with the mussels  They are extra crispy and tasty  The owner told me they have the potatoes sent in fresh daily and they prepared in a special way  No wonder !!    Overall  This is the best mussel shop I tasted so far in my life  I asked Wouter to inform me if they have new recipe  And I shall fly to visit them again !    You can take bus from the upper platform of central station to here  Takes only 10 mins or so  Easy !"
d3626201,October 2022,10,Disappointing,"Frens Haringhandel    What a disappointment!    This place was highly recommended by my friend Helene, as a foodie I totally trusted her!    2 days I waited to visit this place! Big Fan if Herrings, Matjes, Smoked Eel etc. So I got up early to get ready and be the first in line, after all this is supposingly a very popular place! (No lines, just emptyness, but in fairness I was early & it was raining)    My mouthwatering got the better of me, as I slowly approached this little shack! Proudly displaying the Dutch Flag! The real McCoy so I hoped!    Took a picture from the side and as I entered the place, I asked rather politely if I could take a picture! BIG MISTAKE!    This is how it went:    Man on left:  “I am not Micky Mouse”    Rather stunned I asked him why would he say that, I thought it was rather impolite!    The Lady:  It’s a misunderstanding! She tried to smooth it over!    My reply:  There is no misunderstanding! It was what he said and rather not nice, I explained I have been looking forward to try their dishes!    The the Man on the right:  Thank You, and showed me the door!    Rarely do I get stunned, but here we go!    On the way out I took a picture nevertheless only to be called: “A….hole” No price for guessing my reply!    So here we go, while all interactions were ever we went so far in Holland was polite, professional & of high standards, this encounter was exceptionally disappointing!    So I ended up having a baked cheese toast somewhere else! Disappointed that this has happened!    Piece of advice, if you are lucky enough to want to try! Don’t ask taking picture first! Just spend your money first, and then may be, just may be, you might be able to take a shot!    #amsterdam #notclean #travels #exploring #stunning #countryside #exceptionalhomeowners #beautifulholland #beautyfulnetherlands #terribleservice #frensharinghandel #disappointing"
d3626201,July 2022,40,Great for a fast lunch,"We stopped for a quick, light lunch. One order of the Fried Cod was fine for the two of us. Friendly service. Very reasonably priced."
d3626201,May 2022,50,Best herrings in Amsterdam,"We set out for five days determined to eat a herring every day, in a different part of the city. This is the only one we returned to - and we took vacuum packed fillets home, too. We had early season herrings, fat and oily, delicious on their own or with onions and on a bun. We also tasted the small shrimps, smoked and just right. Excellent, and if you find a seat - also an excellent place to people watch. Take your time and enjoy."
d3626201,November 2021,50,This stall was visited by the late Anthony Bourdain in the episode 'The Layover Amsterdam',"YES, in case you're wondering: this is the stall Anthony Bourdain visited in the episode 'The Layover Amsterdam'. The specialty of the house is the baby herring (in Dutch 'maatje') and it is served straight up with onions and pickles, with or without a sandwich (I recommend eating it like the Dutch: not cut and no sandwich).  If you like sushi or rollmops, you'll also be able to appreciate this Dutch treat.  The current price for a straight-up baby herring with no sandwich is € 3,50, so it's a bit pricey but you do get quality for it in return."
d3626201,June 2020,50,Delicious,"Whenever I pass by Frans Haringhandel I always buy and enjoy a hearing. I’ve no idea how many I’ve eaten but it has to be several hundred. Consistent high quality.. The shrimp,other herring and cooked fish available is also of Hin qualty."
d3626201,July 2020,50,Great herring sandwiches,Very nice sandwiches ! Just bread with herring and you can add onions and pickles if you want. The herring tasted wonderful but they also have other choices of fishes. Simple but perfect !
d3626201,March 2020,50,The place for seafood on the go,"This seafood stall is a must for anyone curious about Dutch snack food.It is in a popular spot and in the current situation is a Godsend.The staff run a clean efficient service, and the food is fresh and delicious to eat.The Kibbelings with mayonnaise melted in the mouth."
d3626201,January 2020,50,Must try,"It was my first time to try raw herring. i am used to smoked herring from where i come from and never thought of it as a raw. i thought i will have hard time to finish my bites but the reality was unexpected, i made one more :)    Location is convenient in the middle of the city and next to tram station. can't wait for another raw herring experience one day."
d3626201,February 2020,50,"Delicious, well-prices, well-positioned.","Delicious, well-prices, well-positioned. Efficient and just overall yum!  We stopped off for a little snack, we really enjoyed the food and the owners were friendly."
d3626201,November 2019,50,Fabulous!,"We finally stopped for herring at the stall after walking past it several times during our week in Amsterdam. We had herring in several restaurants, but needed to have the true experience of eating herring on the street. We love fish and we loved the herring. I wish we had these stalls in the US!!"
d3626201,November 2019,50,Fantastic haring....,"As soon as I arrive in the city of Amsterdam I race to buy the traditional haring (herring) served in a bread roll with finely chopped raw onion & gherkin!! It’s absolutely fantastic, the haring melts in your mouth. Current price is €4.50  Don’t leave Amsterdam without eating a haring from this stall, it’s essential."
d3626201,September 2019,50,Must visit institution,"When in Amsterdam, you have to eat a Herring at one of these stalls. Frens is very good and the fish was very fresh, think of it as sort of Dutch Sushi."
d3626201,September 2019,50,Had to try it!,Yep. Had to try it. I did and wanted more. I was so sad that I wasn’t staying longer as I wouldn’t mind eating here daily.
d3626201,December 2018,50,A must-eat when in Amsterdam,"On our recent visit to Amsterdam, everyone had told us that we had to stop by Frens Haringhandel to have the freshest herring (haring) in town. It didn't disappoint! There was a line, but it moved quickly, and their fish was delicious. Great for a mid-morning snack, or on your way to visit any of the local attractions.  Even my 12 year-old daughter loved the herring here!"
d3626201,September 2019,40,Good but bones are not removed,"I reccomend the Kibbeling; deep fried fish, cooked to order. The herring is nice but bones being left in is a shame. The Kibbeling fish in the was fresh and flakey."
d7285568,October 2022,50,"Exquisite service, great food","The restaurant is located in the heart of Amsterdam. The food is delicious and the service is exquisite. Although they were short staffed the day we dined there, we didn't feel the difference. Highly recommend!"
d7285568,September 2022,50,Canal views with quick service,"We stopped here for an early lunch on our way to Amsterdam Centraal. My wife and I both ordered the chicken/bacon toastie, a toasted sandwich with melted cheese. It came out promptly and tasted yummy. A great short stop along our travels. The setting is along a quieter canal with indoor/outdoor dining option. Staff was friendly and cheerful."
d7285568,September 2022,10,"Delicious food, terrible service!","This could have been an easy 5 stars if it were only for the food and views but service was rather poor at this establishment. Zero acknowledgment from anyone and everyone, especially the ""supervisor"" who made us wait for 20 mins while there were plenty of empty tables by the canal and folks who walked in after us seated themselves without any interaction with the host. Guess that's how it worked here but I didn't understand why we were specifically asked to wait. Food was quite delicious when our orders were finally taken and served and eating our meal by the canal was phenomenal. It wasn't a surprise that the check came right as we finished eating. To me, preferential treatment in the restaurant business is completely unacceptable. We received amazing service all around everywhere else on our trip."
d7285568,September 2022,50,Great food and amazing services,"Superb food, friendly service, great location and very affordable prices. What more does one want?! Located on a beautiful canal at the edge of the red light district this little restaurant with both outside and indoor seating is a little gem. The owner, Nathan, used family recipes to creat simple yet very tasteful and beautifully presented dishes. Highly recommended"
d7285568,August 2022,50,Fantastic restaurant. Highly recommend!!,"This restaurant is fantastic. The setting on the canal is gorgeous, on a less touristy street. The atmosphere was just delightful and the food delicious. Our waiter was kind and funny. Highly recommend."
d7285568,August 2022,50,"Yummy, lovely staff",Yummy! Lovely staff. Went on a busy Saturday (pride weekend). Interior was closed due to staff shortage but friendly staff took our order and delivered food all in good time. Quality of food was not compromised. We had a very nice frittata and open chicken sandwich which was a generous portion of real chicken breast The ice T was delicious. Definitely recommend
d7285568,August 2022,50,Greta brunch,Amazing service and tasty food! The owners are so nice and friendly. They couldn’t have been nicer. The food and menu were perfect.

d7285568,July 2022,50,Very good,Very good food which I didn't expect at this place in Amsterdam. Amsterdam is after all very average
d7285568,July 2022,50,Lovely Sunday brunch at the Canal,"Lovely Sunday brunch at a super nice place with terrasse next to the canal.  Enjoying the boats passing by , eating healthy and colourful home made food  Great atmosphere with warm welcoming and friendly waitresses  We could not leave this beautiful spot!!!  Experience it by yourself :-)"
d7285568,May 2022,40,Cute place,Cozy and cute place to have a meal. The staff is welcoming and friendly. Portions are big. Although the one star is missing because I had sand-like something (I believe it was some spice) in my frittata.
d7285568,May 2022,50,Simply great food,"Great and delicious food with fair prices. Cosy atmosphere both inside and outside. We got the open sandwiches with salmon and avocado for lunch, which were amazing . Service was efficient en excellent."

d1649973,November 2019,50,Simply excellent. It aint,"Simply excellent. It aint easy to do simple food that really stands out and makes you want more. You can see that the ingredients utilised are of high quality. The green pea soup was the best. The mustard soup also amazing. A simple toast and fried eggs with bacon and cheese that makes you wanna eat on your knees. Totally worth a lot of visits.    Ah! Also their steak and cheese sandwich, so delicious."
d1649973,November 2019,40,Nice food,"The food is really delicious, wedged a mixture of juices and steak sandwiches. Everyone loved their food. I'd have given them 5 stars had the guy behind the counter been a little less surly."

d3733326,March 2020,50,Best coffee in Amsterdam,"Best coffee in Amsterdam, lovely staff. We moved to Amsterdam a month ago, live at the other side of the city and keep coming back to this hidden gem. No place else beats this coffee. Good vibes staff, great atmosphere."

d3733326,February 2020,50,The best food in amsterdam!,"Lovely staff, friendly and accommodating. Menu is basics but there is something for everyone. Food is great and definitely matches the photos!

d3733326,January 2020,50,Our favorite meal in Amsterdam!,What delicious grilled cheese sandwiches! Great stop in a warm eatery on a chilly day. The service was excellent and the atmosphere very pleasant. So glad we had lunch here.
d10461623,October 2022,50,Amazing meal!,"Couldn’t recommend this restaurant enough!    We had the mixed grill which was one of the specials that day. The chicken, steak and ribs were sooooo good! The ribs had so much meat on them and, like the other meats, were cooked to perfection.    The restaurant was such a cosy wee place and had such a lovely atmosphere. It was the perfect setting for a date.    The service we received was above and beyond! The owner/waiter was so attentive, accommodating, warm and friendly. When we had to leave quickly to get to a booking we had, he was so quick to serve us despite a large group having just walked in.    Would recommend to anyone!"
d10461623,October 2022,50,Very nice experience,"Excellent service, comfortable place, owner also serves the customers in the most beautiful way possible and the most important thing is very tasty food"
d10461623,October 2022,50,Nader Grill was great!!,"First meal in Amsterdam and by far the best! Never had such fantastic ribs!! Went for the mixed grill with salad & fries definitely a big portion. Owner was very polite & courteous, I look forward to returning."
d10461623,October 2022,30,Good place on a cold windy night,"Pleasant owner waited on us. Steak was tasty , just tough. Cooked as ordered and served with great fries and salad. Lamb chops were very good. Wine was reasonably priced and good."
d10461623,October 2022,10,Better not,Very poor experience  Although we explained him about an allergy one of the persons had he wasn’t careful at all  He forgot to bring one of the appetizers  But the most important the meat was cold and in a very bad quality  A meat that costs 25€  Wouldn’t suggest it  Very expensive for what it offers
d10461623,October 2022,30,Review,"The restaurant was very clean and had great food. It had a family sense of restaurant, nonetheless ok. The owner seemed very friendly and the service was good."
d10461623,September 2022,50,Repeat visit & even better than remembered!,"Repeat visit with same group, as enjoyed such great steaks and meals on last visit, and this time we weren't disappointed again! I had one of the best rib eye steaks, (definitely comparable to some of the best, higher priced steakhouses and restaurants). This is a small jewel, with friendly service, and admittedly may not be the trendiest, most fashionable spot, but if its a great steak you're after also at very good value then you can't go wrong ! (Ribs & burgers also good!)"
d10461623,August 2022,50,Best steakhouse in Amsterdam,Great family run establishment and Best steakhouse in Amsterdam. Bahaa the owner is brilliant and made some great recommendations. Highly recommended
d10461623,August 2022,50,Wonderful lunch,Had a wonderful lunch here with the family. Food excellent and a pleasure to meet Boris the owner. Such a genuine man who made us feel like part of his family. Next time in Amsterdam will be at This restaurant with the main man! Thank you Boris
d10461623,July 2022,50,great food and great people working there!,"One of the best restaurants i’ve eaten in Amsterdam, the owner was the best! I found this restaurant through google maps, and it was a great surprise!  He was super nice to me and my family and the food was great. I fell in love with the place and the food, everything was spectacular and I had a great time!  If I ever come back to Amsterdam i’ll for sure eat here!  hopefully we’ll meet again!"
d10461623,July 2022,50,Boris is a great host in the restaurant,"Extremely satisfied with a restaurant, food and staff. Boris is one of the nicest person I’ve met in Netherlands. He had made our experience in the restaurant unforgettable and warm. Really grateful for people like Boris who have such dedication to work and who are a reflection of a restaurant and a city in general. The stakes very delicious by the way"
d10461623,June 2022,50,Excellent Grill Variety,This Place was Excellent on Variety of Grill Foods. Taste was magnificent. The Price was not Bad at All. The Service by (Boris) who was our Waiter was phenomenal. I Will Definitely recommend Trying this place out for Yourself . I Will Definitely Go Back There..  Yash. Shantal. Runav and Taharia.
d10461623,June 2022,50,Best Baklava ever!,"The stakes were amazing, the service was excelent but the best were the deserts: baklava and apple pie! Definitely one of the highlights of our trip to Amsterdam!"
d10461623,May 2022,50,One of the best,"An excellent meal. The steak was prepared exactly like I asked for, and on top of that the service and the location were great… highly recommended"
d10461623,May 2022,50,Afternoon Meal was Fantastic,"Hard Rock was full so I used Trip Advisor to find another restaurant not far that would have steak or chicken. My co-worker is not too adventurous. The steaks and prawns were fabulous!! We had some wonderful bread and the roasted vegetables were so fresh. My drink of choice was sangria and it was wonderful, too. I would highly recommend this restaurant. We went around 4 PM and had no reservation."
d9796658,November 2022,50,The best pancakes best vibe,"MOAK always delivers - great vibe, amazing pancakes and cool branding. I’ll never come to Amsterdam without eating at least one brunch there 💜"
d9796658,October 2022,10,"Bad pancakes, not worth the hype.","This was a terrible experience.  The costumer service were exstremely slow and the pancakes is not worth the hype.  We stood in line for 1 hour even though there were 3-4 empty tables in the restaurant.  The pancakes was like eating a wet sandcake. Then were tasteless and dry.  I would recommend “pancake factory” instead, way better service and pancakes.  DONT GO!"
d9796658,October 2022,50,Cool place with nice food - great breakfast spot.,Went here on a trip to Amsterdam with some friends. Lots of space and a nice cool interior. Very clean. Menu was varied without being overwhelming. Lots to chose from. Good options for veggies. Would recommend.
d9796658,October 2022,50,Best pancakes in Amsterdam,Best pancakes iv had in Amsterdam by far would definitely recommend worth the visit. Ordered the mancake best for a savoury treat.
d9796658,October 2022,50,The best pancakes in Amsterdam!,"Tried The Blue Magic Pancakes, sooo good! Fluffy and airy, stuffed with fresh big blueberries, so delicious! I had all the blueberry experience in every bite, it tasted like heaven! Keep in mind to add some extra blueberries over the pancakes, it makes the real difference! The staff was so helpful!"
d9796658,September 2022,40,Pancakes and good vibes,"Very cool atmosphere, staff was very nice. The food was delicious, we ended up trying The Goldigger. Presentation was perfect and the pistachio ice cream was delicious. Overall a great place and will definitely be back!"
d9796658,September 2022,50,Brilliant pancakes,"Between us we had two savory pancakes, vegetarian and smoked salmon, each had a yummy avocado hidden under the hummus and the dill/ creme fraiche. Highly recommended. Good coffee too. Service was a bit hap hazard, waitress forgot to place half our order, but we were not in a rush so we didn't make a fuss. One recommendation would be to have the possibility to order one small sweet pancake, if you have had a savoury one to start. The options on the menu involving 3 pancakes were too much."
d9796658,September 2022,50,Nice and chill,"Very good stuff ! Staff was super friendly and we loved the concept. Very chill, with good tasty pancakes and great drink menu"
d9796658,August 2022,50,Amazing pancakes,"This is the place for the best pancakes in Amsterdam! Amazing staff and delicious food! Good price, you must go"
d9796658,August 2022,50,Delicious pancake variations!,"The food here was great, and they were very accommodating to our large group of 7. I had the pink lady and it was fantastic. Just what we needed after an early flight into town!"
d9796658,August 2022,50,Amazing pancakes,It was very delicious ! The concept is so cool ! The place was very beautiful ! We don’t found it in France and it’s to bad !
d9796658,August 2022,40,wowowow!,"so good! man cake is to die for, and you can’t leave without trying the saffron pistachio ice cream. my only regret is that we didn’t have the stomach to order everything on the menu"
d9796658,August 2022,50,WOW! must try if you like fun pancakes and great atmosphere,"Went here on last day of trip in Amsterdam, and got the man cake and ice ice baby - both incredible!! Super filling and super unique well thought out flavor combinations. The saffron pistachio ice cream is excellent and the decor snd interior is super cute :) would recommend!!"
d9796658,July 2022,50,Ridiculously good,"The pancakes were seriously amazing! It was busy but we got seated quickly, and the pancakes were out super quickly too, thank you Moak 😊 we will definitely come again!"
d9796658,July 2022,10,Discussing Bready mess,"For a pancake place the pancakes are just awful. They are big bread lumps showed with fancy toppings to try and make them look better but just can’t take away from what actually underneath, a horrible pancake. The whole place feels like a gen z attraction shop trying to law in American tourists and failing miserably. Avoid this place at all costs and steer clear when in Amsterdam. You have been warned."
d697045,October 2022,20,"Poor service, average menu","othing special, neither food nor service. We went for lunch with my family and had a couple of burgers and soup. Flavors and presentation were average, nothing special or particularly elaborate. Two points worth noting: the bill was overcharged with some additional fries that we never had -we were not even informed that was a menu option-, when we asked to the same waiter that had served us she clearly looked annoyed by the fact that she had to recalculate the bill, nothing of the likes, ""am sorry let me get you a new bill"", she was rude and annoyed, probably by her own fault. Second thing which really was weird is that when we were leaving the restaurant I saw other guests having very different things that what the waiter had offered on the menu, when I informed about it she said, "" the menu I offered you is for Dutch people because they usually only like to eat sandwich and soups"" that is why I did not offered you the extended one... (!!??) first of all I am not Dutch and I already thought that the menu was really poor. She said she had assumed I am Dutch and only eat bread because I had spoken to her in Dutch....again no apologies but just a big mouth back: ""well next time you can come and order the extended menu"" she said. Very strange waiter, young and inexperienced. I understand that there is shortage for good staff in the city specially in the horeca, but please make at least an effort to train your staff properly and best of all, teach them some good manners with your customers."
d697045,October 2022,50,Excellent food & friendly atmospheric cafe,"Lovely small café, with a changing daily menu affording some varied choices, as well as some signature dishes such as steak with strawberry sauce & goats cheese which I think is always on offer. Very friendly & efficient service, and although reservations aren't possible its worthwhile to pop round and generally can get a table within a shortish waiting period, or even grab a seat at the bar."
d697045,October 2022,50,Excellent restaurant and great value,"We arrived late and without reservation but they managed to fit us in. The 2 waiting staff were very polite and provided excellent service.  There is no menu, but the menu included meat/fish/veg so there is something for everyone!  We started with the blue cheese, bacon & date which was amazing! And the homemade pate was good too.  For mains the beef with cheese and strawberry jus was exceptional. My partner had the broccoli soup which was great.  The dark beer is very good.  With no idea of the price (due to no menu) we were very pleasantly surprised to see how reasonably priced the bill was! Would highly recommend"
d697045,October 2022,40,A fun experience with hearty food,"The restaurant famous for having no menu. Really enjoyed our lunch experience.  Mussels starter delicious. Hake with chorizo good. The Indonesian spiced chicken moist but underwhelming. Good local beer. A drinks carte wouldn’t go amiss, particularly if you want to know the price of the drinks. A fun experience with hearty food"
d697045,September 2022,50,"Great restaurant, excellent food",This restaurant was recommended by the owner of Those Dam Boat Guys. What a gem! The menu was explained by the excellent staff and I have to say the food when it arrived was mouthwatering - cooked to perfection. We arrived reasonably early but realised very quickly that we were lucky to get a table as by the time we left there were a number of people waiting to get in.
d697045,September 2022,50,Excellent food and atmosphere,"Excellent food, good service in a nice setting. ‘Gezellig’ as we say. We enjoyed the menu and the wines. If you want to go to a non tourist restaurant, this is a nice place to go"
d697045,August 2022,50,Great food and experience,"The best meal we had in Amsterdam! The staff were so friendly and lovely and the food varied and delicious. They don't take reservations so we walked in and they offered us a seat at the small bar, which serves great local beers as well as wine and spirits, for about ten minutes or so until a table was available. Then the menu was recited to us and our orders taken from memory. While we ate our excellent starters and mains we could see the very enticing selection of desserts on the counter behind us, so we couldn't resist getting some of those too! I and my partner are vegetarian and had great options, as did the two meat eaters wirh us. A brilliant evening in every respect."
d697045,August 2022,50,Mamma knows best!,Had a wonderful experience at this authentic venue. Decor is beautiful and staff are amazing. Asked for recommendations and mamma knew best! Asked the right questions and was spot on with her suggestions. Wonderful food. Great atmosphere and great value for money. We’re only in the city for 2 days and I may well come back here tomorrow.
d697045,August 2022,50,Wonderful!,Excellent food and service. Live the concept of no fixed menu and the owner sat down and reviewed the dishes of the day. Fast service and friendly. Great mix of locals and tourists. Small restaurant but with ample seating and short wait time for a solo. Will be coming back with a larger group.
d697045,August 2022,40,Fab little find,"Happened to find this place by chance, the food was superb. The waiter recites the menu, so nothing is printed to read. But the 3 guys serving were all so helpful, the steak was very tasty and the pear desert (made by the owners mother) was superb.  The value of the meal also surprised me, head and shoulders above anywhere else I ate at during my stay."
d697045,August 2022,50,Definitely worth a visit,"Went to this restaurant after reading the reviews, well it was certainly worth it.  Staff were fantastic, very welcoming, we chatted with them whilst at the bar waiting for our table.  The food well, I would show you pictures, however we were so busy enjoying it that the only pictures we actually took were of empty plates. The four of us had various dishes, including a fish dish with the fish so fresh, it was to die for. The chicken in coconut sauce was so tasty, it was to be savoured. The Steak with Strawberry sauce with Goats cheese, was a wonder.    Deserts were also terrific, plus a nice coffee to end.    Be patient with the team, it gets busy, so you might be lucky to get a table straight away, if not it is worth sitting at the bar until a table becomes available. They do not take bookings.    A meal not to forget, thank you."
d697045,August 2022,50,Hidden gem,"One of the best meals I’ve had I in awhile, and definitely the best mussels I’ve had in my whole life. We ordered several starters and loved everything. Great setting, yummy drinks, fabulous food, and super friendly service. If you’re looking for a cozy dinner in the middle of a hectic city, this is your place!"
d697045,June 2022,50,"Love, love, love!!!","A gorgeous, family run restaurant in the heart of Amsterdam. The food was utterly delicious and the service friendly and efficient. An absolute find!"
d697045,July 2022,50,Fabulous,"We had a fabulous early dinner here - mussels, smoked mackerel mousse, Dutch style steak, hake, pear cake accompanied by Pinot Grigio. Service was perfect."
d697045,July 2022,50,An authentic family owned restaurant,"We found this restaurant online while searching for restaurants for a birthday meal. Lovely building and environment inside and out. Service was outstanding from start to finish. The waitress explained the menu in detail, describing the dishes, listening to our preferences and recommending us the most appropriate dish. It was evident that the waitress was passionate about her city, her restaurant and the food they were serving. Excellent food. Will be returning on my next visit to Amsterdam and would recommend to anyone visiting the city."
d8092753,May 2022,50,Great Middle Eastern Restaurant,"We went here for lunch and had a very good meal. We got some appetizers and falafel plates, and the menu is very vegetarian and vegan friendly. The food was fresh, and the staff was very friendly. Because Uber wasn't working that day, they also called us a cab to get back to our hotel in the Museum Quarter."
d8092753,October 2022,40,Nice authentic middle eastern flavors,"We were a company of 6 and 1 person was vegan. We did sit outside as it is rather noisy inside. The weather was perfect so it was even better to enjoy the outdoors. We ordered 6 ""This & That"" and mentioned that we wanted 1 for a vegan. The hummous was really good and the fallafel of the best i have taste. As we come from Cyprus we have lebanese and Syrian food quite often, so i have a goo measure of comparisson,  The service was good and the waitress was keen to serve.  We thoroughly enjoyed the experience and the prices were very reasonable."
d8092753,October 2022,30,Nice but sit outside if you any to converse.,"Food nice, not exceptional.  Excessively loud music and though we were the only guests inside the restaurant, our request to dim it down a bit was met with an eye-roll when our very nice and friendly server asked the rather disinterested woman in charge to turn it down. Two minutes later the music was put on in full again.  Take it ear plugs to go into the loo as the speakers are at maximum strength there n the confined space."
d8092753,August 2022,50,Love this place!,"We found this restaurant on a review site while visiting Amsterdam. It was absolutely perfect. Delicious food, warm and welcoming staff, lovely cute atmosphere. We really loved it and the neighborhood is beautiful to explore. Highly recommend."
d8092753,August 2022,20,Very disappointing.,"I came here with high expectations due to what I read on various social media. First of all, we waited 40 minutes for our food but all the stuff they do is clearly prepared beforehand (I won’t believe they make hummus or falafels on the spot). The food itself was quite good (although nothing exceptional) but way too overpriced. The worst part was the eggplant: 10,50€ for one roasted eggplant with some tahini is really unacceptable and ridiculous. Portions are not that big. Honestly would not come back."
d8092753,August 2022,50,Excellent,"Excellent friendly staff. Food was outstanding very tasty. The food was very well presented, the tapwater was free! And refillable. The portions are very generous and although you only get three pitta breads that is more than enough. if you want excellent value for money and you like Hummus this is the place for you. We will definitely return here if we are ever in Amsterdam again."
d8092753,July 2022,50,Tasty mediterranean restaurant in Jordaan,This was one of the great surprises of the trip. We had it on our list before going and they delivered. The food was tasty and well prepared and the staff was friendly. The price was good and the experience was just top-notch.    They had both indoor and outdoor seating. The only complaint was that the music was too loud inside.
d8092753,July 2022,50,So good we had to go twice,Stumbled upon this place for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Greeted by the lovely doggy host on arrival we grabbed a seat in the garden. I had the shakshouka which was delicious and my friend also enjoyed the hummus cauliflower.    We enjoyed it so much we went the next day and I tried the hummus this time… so delicious!    Next time I’m in Amsterdam I’ll be sure to visit.
d8092753,July 2022,50,Greatly recommended,"Great service, a very cozy setting and absolutely amazing food. If your in Amsterdam, treat yourself to an all-round wonderful experience."
d8092753,July 2022,50,Hidden gem,"Extremely friendly staff and amazing food quality. One of the best hummus I ever had, vegan friendly as well and a nice location."
d8092753,July 2022,50,Craving falafel,I think that’s the best falafel I ever had. The side salads were all really tasty too. Everything we ordered was great. It was a great choice for authentic food in a pleasant casual setting.
d8092753,May 2022,40,Lunch in Amsterdam,"Lovely Israeli food. Highly recommend for lunch. Very tasty hummus based plates, lots of choice & would definitely recommend when visiting Amsterdam."
d8092753,May 2022,50,Good Israeli food,We visited the one on Maastraat for lunch. The dishes were really good and the service helpfull and friendly. We will definitely come back!
d8092753,April 2022,50,Hummus,Great 👍🏾 yeasty and great service The hummus is good and the siniya is great Thank you for tasty food
d8092753,June 2021,50,Simply great !,The food was super tasty and well presented. Friendly helpful staff and good prize. Excelent all around. Have been there multiple times
d696917,September 2022,50,"Amazing experience, incredible food","I came here on my birthday and my first day in Amsterdam. After a missed flight I practically had to sprint there to make my reservation, and I am SO happy I did. Every single bite was incredible. I ate foods I would never normally order and I enjoyed every single dish. I tried to take photos of each course, as they were artfully prepared. However, with that in mind between courses, I don't think I managed to take even one photo without taking a bite first, I was just too excited for what they had in store. Also, I felt great after eating this meal. The menu on the day I came was mostly plant-based, filling, and absolutely delicious!!! It energized me to explore beautiful Amsterdam. I cannot recommend De Kas enough. The staff was exceptional and gave me a small pot of honey to make my birthday even ""sweeter."" It will always be a great memory."
d696917,September 2022,40,"Interesting, tasty and great experience","Great food, beautifully presented with helpful,pleasant staff- certainly recommend: definitely a super experience and lively location"
d696917,August 2022,50,Amazing food and environment,"Such a great experience, we had the five-course menu and everything was delicious, each dish was creative and unique. Definitely recommend De Kas when in Amsterdam!"
d696917,August 2022,50,"Wonderful food, fresh ingredients, awesome staff","AMAZING! This was my first time at a restaurant with a set number of courses etc. first of all, the location is beautiful. It is located outside of the city center within a beautiful park.    The staff were incredibly nice and took the time to explain the restaurant concept to us as well as its history.    My favorite was the mussels and the unique ice cream at the end.    The many little dishes and unique combinations forced me to try things that I wouldn’t usually try and I was blown away by the taste of them.    I highly recommend the restaurant to any visitors that want a unique dining experience full of interesting and delicious food.    The inside of the restaurant was also lovely. I noticed that many locals dine there in addition to other English speaking tourists. It’s a great break from the very touristy central Amsterdam."
d696917,August 2022,50,Fabulous experience outside of Amsterdam's center,"The term ""farm to table"" is the most misused adjective in the restaurant industry. However in the case of De Kas it is apt given you are eating within their vast setting where most of their food comes from. The four course luncheon menu was appropriately light for a midday meal and each course was nicely prepared and the food was superb especially the sauces (I am a big sauce guy). A must go"
d696917,July 2022,50,Quality time with family,Super fresh ingredients from the greenhouse. The service from Rodney was excellent! Great ambiance! The celebration of our daughter’s (bachelor) graduation was a great success.
d696917,June 2022,50,De Kas..Michelin one star experience not to be missed,"I found De Kas while researching things to do in Amsterdam and was fortunate to do so. The restaurant experience is not to be missed if you are looking for a unique dining experience. The menu is based on the daily harvest from the restaurants farm and greenhouse. We were treated to the first tomatoes of the season which were prepared with lemon zest, olive oil and basil--very refreshing!The plates are culinary art with unique use of the fresh produce. The service is first class with explanations of each course. A wide variety of wines are available to complement the meal. The homemade lemoncello is not to be missed. De Kas is in an oasis from the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam. We had a 1330 lunch reservation and did not leave until 1645...which included a walk through the greenhouse. De Kas is now a one star Michelin restaurant and not to be missed."
d696917,June 2022,50,A highlight - picked in the morning on the plate by evening,"What a classic / fun / unusual and delicious dinner. I can’t wait to return in a different season to experience what the kitchen puts out in the fall / winter / spring. At the height of summer, they do amazing things with local produce - just a terrific evening."
d696917,June 2022,50,A nice experience,"The food, the service and the atmosphere of the place are exceptional. A little bit overpriced but all in all it was a great experience. The menu is fixed so you will have your courses in appetizers served one by one and as my friend (local to Amsterdam) it changes everyday."
d696917,May 2022,50,Amazing food,"One of the most memorable meals we've had, each dish was fantastic and beautifully presented. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Most of the vegetables they serve are grown in their our greenhouse, which you can walk through, and the gardens around the restaurant are also beautiful."
d696917,April 2022,50,Never Misses A Beat!! Amazing,"My absolute favourite restaurant in Amsterdam, I've been many many times, and it honestly never misses a beat. The food, service and interior are always outstanding. They cater super well to my GF needs and their focus on seasonal local produce is perfect. I love to come for lunch since you can soak in the weather floating by outside, however the evening with all the pretty lights is also beautiful! See you again soon, I am sure!"
d696917,April 2022,50,Nice spot,All good. Service great.menu special. Time to serve very ok. Very nice place. Nice ambience. Nice location. The service was great.
d696917,April 2022,30,"Boring food, great ambiance","Amazing entourage and nice and attentive staff, but a boring menu. It feels they prioritized optics above substance; all courses are pieces of art, but the actual taste and combinations were boring and bland. With fresh produce grown around the restaurant I expected more creativity. I can appreciate vegan and vegetarian food; when done right you don’t miss fish or meat at all, but in this case I felt I was being served side dishes to a nice piece of meat or fish that wasn’t there.    Also the sequence of courses didn’t seem to tell a story of build-up with a head and tail. It felt like a random selection of plates.    Unfortunately this is my experience with “posh” Dutch restaurants in general; “priegelwerk” (tinkering with tiny bits and pieces) but no real substance to it. Pretentious. After 6 courses I was still hungry because I don’t want to fill myself up with bread to compensate, and didn’t remember a single course except the desert which was nice.    Wines were excellent."
d696917,March 2022,50,Relax - You are in for a treat,"Walk into the park, past the storks nesting on top of the huge chimney and enter another world.  Amazing service that settles you into this different zone and then fresh, colourful delicious food will follow. Intense flavours and good textures and all presented like works of art."
d696917,March 2022,50,Fantastic food in a spectacular setting,"Fantastic meal in a beautiful setting. The food is delicious, beautifully presented and inventive. The service is wonderful. A breathtaking setting with the greenhouse adjacent. A must if you are in Amsterdam"
d1319323,October 2022,50,Singel 404 - operating since 1996 - check it out!,"This is up the street fromm the hotel I started working at.  Guests ask where to eat lunch in the neighbourhood. I checked it out.  Terrace along canal side was starting to fill up. Directly inside is a small seating area before bar/kitchen. Custommers were walking past -I guess there is another space in the restaurant tucked away.  They didn't have soup. I ordered salmmon sandwich on brown bread .Was quite a generous size and was tasty with fresh bread, lettuce, smmoked sslmmon, avacado and wasabi(?)-mmayo. Fairly priced. I only had timme for a quick bite.  They've been operating since 1996. I will recommend and go back to try mmore if the mmenu. Nice service! isabelydancer00"
d1319323,August 2022,50,Lovely dinner,"Referred by a local and were super happy with our meal. Great ambiance, food, and wine. We enjoyed eating outside in this local spot and savored a wonderful meal. About a 20-minute taxi ride from the City center of Amsterdam. Worth the drive."
d1319323,August 2022,40,First lunch in Amsterdam.,"We stumbled on Singel 404 on our first day in Amsterdam. Friendly staff, great location and tasty food. The warm goat cheese and pumpkin sandwich on Gluten free bread was delicious."
d1319323,June 2022,50,Best spare ribs in Amsterdam!,"Cora was very accommodating and made reservations for 16 of us. We absolutely loved everything, including the appetizers and the spare ribs (which by the way, are the best in Amsterdam)!"
d1319323,August 2021,50,Love it!,"I've been to Eetcafe Singel 404 alot times over the years and always enjoyed it. Fresh delicious food at a reasonable price, perfect for lunch! Particularly nice during the summer. The service is always fast and friendly. My favourite place to grab lunch in the city."
d1319323,August 2021,50,Good food and wibes,"Singel 404 is a tipical eat-café, you can drink coffee, tea or chocolate and having some food. The meals are gorgeous and lots of inhabitant had their lunch there."
d1319323,July 2020,10,No reason to go here anymore,We used to look forward to go here but it appears as if there is new management or ownership. Different menu and more expensive.
d1319323,January 2020,10,Something has changed- bad,We have been coming here for years. We loved the place. This time everything was just so average. I got the oven melted goat cheese sandwich with brown bread. The taste was just not delicious. It used to be sooo good. Bread was not crispy goat cheese was not really melted just nothing interesting. Prices went up and most ridiculous is that we asked for a glass of tap water and they told us they only serve tap water if you order a drink. Lol. In the end they indeed changed the owner. There was nothing magic as it was before nothing special. Won’t come back.
d1319323,January 2020,10,Awful Experience / Utter chaos,"Too many tables, not enough staff, incorrect orders being given to customers, food & drinks never arrived and were told to be patient cause it was busy. Many other options in Amsterdam."
d1319323,December 2019,50,"Friendly, welcoming and delicious","The staff immediately impressed me by how friendly and welcoming they are - they all took the time to say hello and to welcome us. The female waitress who served us was also wonderful, giving us help with the drinks menu and helping us pick out the beer we would best like. Then the food - fantastic! You get a great portion and the choices are wonderful. Very delicious and a very lovely atmosphere and experience. Definitely a must for any tourist/couple in Amsterdam!"
d1319323,November 2019,40,"Good food, service not so good","The restaurant serves quick meals, basically hot and cold sandwiches and they are good. The staff needs to be more prepared to work during busy times."
d1319323,October 2019,40,Delicious sandwiches,"We stopped here for a late lunch after reading reviews. Service was quite slow but the waiter was nice and friendly. We ordered the Brie sandwich and bacon and chicken sandwich both on delicious white sourdough bread. The Brie one was best. We did have to wait a while for the sandwiches and when they arrived one of them was wrong. They were very apologetic and gave us a complimentary round of drinks. It’s a quirky little place with nice food, but isn’t the cleanest. Would go back for the Brie sandwich again though"
d1319323,September 2019,50,"Great Respite on Rainy, Cold Blowy Day","Walked in and were told to get out of the aisle, but we were waiting for people to leave a table. Once the server, Ben, realized that, he warmed up to us. We were seated at a small table downstairs. Ben said he was new to the job and ended up being a very nice, freindly and helpful waiter.  I had an Affligem beer which really hit the spot. I also got an arugula salad which was great, since I've been eating so much bread. They don't usually have salads, but I was told to pick a sandwich and they would make it into a salad. Very accommodating. The rest of the group had wurst and sandwiches. Did try some of the other's frites. Always yummy. Everything was tasty with just the right flavors."
d1319323,October 2019,40,Eetcafe,"Cute little place with cat and dog roaming around, lots of locals and charming atmosphere. The servers really ration the bread served with good chicken soup and charge for refills of tea!"
d1319323,September 2019,50,Lunch! Done properly!,"This was a good stop. Lunch with friends on a windy and rainy day. Good selections in menu, quickly served, a lot of food! Great lunchplace!"
d2082910,November 2022,50,Dinner by the canal,A tiny basement restaurant set on a corner by a canal. The host was so friendly and welcoming. The food although limited in choice was excellent. I would certainly return and highly recommend it during a trip to Amsterdam.
d2082910,October 2022,50,Great food in small atmospheric basement,Great cozy basement atmosphere with excellent food (we are both vegetarian) and very friendly team. Cozy might be too much for claustrophobics!
d2082910,September 2022,30,Average restaurant in a basement,"Amsterdam at the height of tourist season is a difficult restaurant city - reservations for good places a must. Unfortunately, we did not plan ahead and went with recommendations. De Struisvogel was an average restaurant with average decor and average food. Located in the basement of a canal house with street access, the room is crowded and somewhat stuffy. The steak in our 2 course fixed price meal was tough. The other dishes were all immemorable."
d2082910,July 2022,10,Ordered the veal and got the worst possible food poisoning,The food poisoning I got from the food at this restaurant lasted for 4 days and I thought I would die.
d2082910,August 2022,50,Great value delicious food,Second visit here and did not disappoint. Great food lovely atmosphere My husband had a delicious steak. I had cod. Would highly recommend
d2082910,June 2022,50,Surprising find near the Grand Canal Boutique hotel,"My wife and I were looking for a restaurant near our hotel and were directed to De Struisvogel. It was a very good experience. The staff was incredibly attentive, the food very good (it is a 2 or 3 course meal with fixed price). The restaurant is intimate with wonderful atmosphere."
d2082910,June 2022,50,Warm and inviting restaurant that serves up fabulous food!,"My sister and I ate here and were blown away by the food. We had the set menu, ended up switching plates for our starter as we were both raving about our respective dishes - and both were delicious. Main course was superb and the apple crumble for dessert is not to be missed! The staff were really friendly. Just a fabulous dinner."
d2082910,May 2022,50,A very good surprise! savory and well cooked,Very good. Not a lot of choice but it’s the best way to have fresh and tasty food. Very well cooked. A very good surprise. Staff is very friendly and patient.
d2082910,May 2022,50,Delicious and well cooked food,"Delicious and well prepared food, everything we ate was great. We had tacos( was a nice surprise ) and another starter, the veal well cooked and fish. The dessert sound common apple crumble but it was so tasty & well flavored- with whipped cream."
d2082910,April 2022,50,A meal to savour and enjoy,"This restaurant offered a limited menu but youcould tell it was all cooked to order and very well done. There was a choice to suit everyone. The staff were very friendly, the restaurant always seemed busy so I would advise you book. You will not be disappointed."
d2082910,April 2022,50,"Excellent Food, Service and Atmosphere.","I had been to this restaurant a number of years ago and it was always so lovely. My return did not disappoint and standards remain the same after all these years. The food was delicious, the service impeccable - the lovely waitress was so friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere was just lovely. Worth a visit and somewhere I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.    There is a choice of 3 courses (34.50 euros), 2 courses (28.50) or simply a main (22.50).  We all had a variety from the menu and each of us delighted with our choices.    Booking is recommended. We arrived early evening (having pre-booked) and the restaurant was fully booked for the evening.    I look forward to returning again one day soon."
d2082910,April 2022,50,Worth a visit,"Even though we didn't have a reservation and they seemed pretty booked, the waitors made room for us. From start to finish we were well taken cared of and the staff made sure we had everything we needed. The menu is simple and the staff was a great help as well. Both of us went with three courses, to which the price was great. Everything tasted and looked delicious, the staff was fantastic. Worth a visit if in town!"
d2082910,April 2022,50,Great little find,"We just happened across this little restaurant, hidden in Amsterdam. Great food, great atmosphere, great service! Can highly recommend."
d2082910,April 2022,50,"Cosy restaurant, excellent food","Intimate local feeling, warm and friendly service. The food was really delicious, our plates were cleared!! It was fully booked so reservations are a must"
d2082910,November 2021,50,"Cozy, delicious",Bend your neck (like an ostrich) and look down the stairs into this small but lovely and cozy restaurant! Great service. Great food. The soup of the day (pumpkin & lentil) was absolutely delicious - hearty and warm) and the Gado Gado salad starter was beautifully presented and so tasty ! The restaurant offers a 2 course or 3 course menu (if I remember correctly at 28.50 or 34.50 euro respectively). Alternatively you can have just a main course for R22.50.
d5971541,October 2022,50,Wow! Fabulous dinner!,We visited on recommendation and we were not disappointed. We had the 4 course tasting menu for our daughter’s 21st and ordered mains and desserts for the two youngest. They were included in all the extras - 3 amuse bouche and the extra dessert. The staff could not have been more helpful. Excellent wine recommendations and attentive service from Abel. I would highly recommend it . The food was sublime.
d5971541,June 2022,50,The surprise tasting menu was a delight,We ate here in 2017 and our visit last week lived up to our expectations.  We had the six course tasting menu and every mouthful was a delight.  The waiter described every course and was very friendly. Service was excellent and we look forward to coming back next year.
d5971541,October 2022,10,"A terrible, no good, very disappointing dinner experience","This is the first time I have left a restaurant prior to the tasting menu being completed.  One course was more disappointing than the next with a wait time of one hour between course 2 and 3 in a 7 course meal. On asking what the issue was I was informed the chef was ill  The waiter on serving several of the dishes was asked to describe the plate and said he had no idea as the “chefs surprise tasting meal” was changed that day and he was uninformed of what each dish consisted of.  The first desert was an ice cream bar served at 11pm after a veal dish that was lackluster at best. The meal began at 7 pm!  Needed hot tea to soothe the stomach which was served with virtually no tea leaves hence was basically tasteless hot water After 4 hours decided to settled the bill and skipped the final course  What a disappointment  Beware this is not the same restaurant we have dined in before and the quality of the food and service deserves new management , a revised selection in the chefs choice tasting menu and a change of chefs"
d5971541,October 2022,50,"Delicious, at the level of 1 Michelin star","We had the 5 courses surprise dinner with wine pairing and we enjoyed every bite. They customized the menu because one of us did not eat meat, and all dishes were creative, well balanced and with great flavor. Staff is kind and professional."
d5971541,September 2022,50,Cosy culinary canal cuisine,"Perfect balance between the three elements that make for a fine dining experience : ambiance, food and service are all excellent."
d5971541,September 2022,50,Definitely worth a detour,"Outstanding food, creatively presented. Intimate atmosphere and excellent service. Great value for money."
d5971541,September 2022,50,Just awesome!,"What a nice gem! Food was excellent and so was the service. We did the 5 course and the quality of the dishes was truly amazing. Right pace, right quantities from beginning to end. Would highly recommend it."
d5971541,September 2022,50,Perfect dining experience in the heart of Amsterdam,"Cozy restaurant, friendly and attentive service. The 5 course surprise menu, had two fish as starter, a delicious vegetarian dish (beetroot), rib eye steak in two variations and an amazing dessert. On top quite a number of amuse gueule are added in between. For 65EUR this is a nice experience. Portions are on the smaller side, but it add up... . We chose the matching wines and got 5 glasses of very nice wines perfectly matching the food for 5 countries, 9EUR a glass. When you know some of the wines or check out the ones on the wine list, I personally find a 4 to 5 fold mark up a bit pricy.... but that`s just a side note.  All in all we had a perfect evening in a beautiful setting, with very good service and we will come again. This restaurant is on the edge of getting a one star, if they get a bit more courageous and experimental with their cooking. I wish them good luck!"
d5971541,August 2022,50,Restaurant Johannes,We dined at Restaurant Johannes in August 2022 - we ordered 5 course meal with wine pairings by the glass suggested by our waiter. We had a wonderful experience and would highly recommend!
d5971541,May 2022,50,"Excellent Everything! The food, The staff & The ambiance are ALL 5 stars!","We asked our hotel for a recommendation for dinner and we are so glad they recommended Johannes Restaurant, just a short walk from our hotel The Noblemen. Be sure when you’re in Amsterdam to have dinner here! It’s a beautiful and romantic French restaurant in the heart of Amsterdam facing the Herengracht canal and the food is outstanding! Excellent quality, presentation, service and taste! The manager Peter was so personable and friendly and extremely knowledgeable of every dish. Great dinner, great restaurant! We’ll be back!"
d5971541,April 2022,50,surprise menu was excellent,"enjoyed the 5-course surprise menu! very tasty and staff welcoming. We were a party of 5, and it was a very enjoyable eve."
d5971541,March 2022,50,Excellent Dining Experience,"This is a superb restaurant who clearly love the food they prepare and enjoy telling customers about it to aid their enjoyment. We chose the 4 course taster and they were able to do this too for a vegetarian. All of the dishes were first rate, well complementary flavours and perfectly prepared. The one small issue was the rib of beef was probably not as pink as if I'd had it in England, but still very tasty. Reasonably busy, but the waitress had time to answer questions about the food, wine and restaurant. An excellent dining experience."
d5971541,March 2022,50,Superb,"Wow! This is how food supposed to taste. Entree, service and the quality of food is excellent. We were sitting at the window. Lovely view at the canal!"
d5971541,February 2022,50,Best birthday dinner,"I booked this restaurant for my birthday dinner. They were kind enough to grant my request for a window table. To my surprise, the place was almost empty. There's only 3 tables occupied including mine (maybe because it's off peak season, the weather, it was a weekday plus covid) but it suites me perfectly (as I don't like crowd in general)! I was literally the only diner half way through my meal that it looked like I had the whole place closed all to myself. A good experience I should say. The ambiance was pleasant, comfortable, romantic. The staff were attentive, cheerful and thoughtful. And the food, divine! Everything was mouth-watering and interesting. The staff explained every bit on the plate and I was almost always surprised by the combination of flavors and ingredients. I paid for a 5-course meal (surprise menu) but have been served more than that. Everything about this dinner was perfect. One of my best dining experience. I would definitely go back and highly recommend this place!"
d5971541,March 2022,50,Delicious,"We were looking for an Etoilé, but impossible to find a table. We don’t regret our choice to discover Johannes. Everything was sophisticated and delicious. We will return for sure."
d10214338,October 2022,50,Top class food and service!,"Great food, super service! We had the finger food combo, oysters, octopus, sea food soup and a mango and prawn salad. All superb and great quality."

d10214338,September 2022,50,Good food exceptional service,Great food as always. I come here every time I’m in Amsterdam. Amazing service. Thank you so much Sergi! Best service very attentive
d7689983,June 2022,50,This restaurant is an absolute list for anyone visiting Amsterdam.,"The restaurant is an absolute gem. I cannot express in words how good this place is. The food is amazing, the portions just right and the service attentive but not over the top. I’m they have wine to compliment each of the dishes and it was heavenly. I will not forget my experience at this am assuming but absolutely outstanding restaurant. Would recommend to anyone visiting Amsterdam."
d7689983,June 2022,40,Lovely ambiance and great service.,"Really enjoyed the food    - opted for 5 courses. 2 were fish based, I was meat, 1 was a vegetable and 1 dessert. Also opted for cheese course  - wine recommendation from Umbria (orange wine) was great  - the fish dishes were standouts, meat course was hearty and hit the spot, the vegetable was underwhelming (was grilled asparagus but was still soft and personally preferred crispier texture)  - service was attentive and pleasant    Highly recommend for residents and visitors alike"
d7689983,September 2020,50,An amazing experience,We have decided to celebrate my partners birtday at Guts. We chosen both the Basic (5-course) tasting menu which I can only reccommend. We loved every single dish but my personal favorite was the starting course which costisted of many little sharing plates. I am personally not a big fan of fish but the way Guts flavoured it made me absolutely love that dish too. Also we appreciated that on Sundays there is an option to bring your own drinks to the reservation. The waiter was absolutely lovely and attentive. Alltogether we had a beutiful evening at the restaurant and will definitely come back again.
d7689983,August 2020,50,"Fantastic food, great wine recommendations and especially great staff","The five course tasting menu was wonderful. The staff, especially our waiter, were first class. A great dining experience that I would highly recommend"
d7689983,February 2020,10,Terrible customer service & very expensive,This place is extremely expensive and nowhere close to justifying the expensive dining. When I was given the wine list it starts at 50eur for a bottle. We had the tasting experience from the chef and I found a lot of the dishes to be quite average and mostly cold (which says to me lazy). I also had an issue (which I will not share publicly) which caused me good reason to complain and the customer service was terrible. I was treated very badly and made to feel like I had done something wrong in complaining - given I'd just spent 250eur on dinner I was absolutely gobsmacked and devastated. This place ruined a romantic weekend for me.
d7689983,March 2020,40,Good food,"We didnt have a reservation, but still they managed super well the allergies and vegetarians. We had the basic set menu for dinner. Excellent food, nice flavour combinations, cozy ambience, nice wine suggestion and super kind waiter. A place to come back."
d7689983,February 2020,50,Excellent dinner,"It’s difficult to find a good restaurant in a city that has so much choice but this has got to be my favourite restaurant in Amsterdam, maybe in Europe. Firstly it’s easy, you pick the basic tasting menu or you upgrade to an additional course (in this case Turbot), we stuck with the basic and didn’t feel that we missed out. It’s amazing value at €49.50 (maybe I spend too much time in London) and the service is sophisticated. To be clear, you won’t know what you’re eating when you make your reservation but based on our experience I’d definitely recommend Guts to anyone looking for a nice place to dine."
d7689983,February 2020,50,Amazing Birthday Celebration,"Dinner in Guts on Friday Night . Tasting menu ,Beautiful selection and Very innovative and creative cooking . Extremely friendly and efficient Team. A real gem and a lovely Buzzy atmosphere. Will be back on next visit !!"
d7689983,December 2019,50,Absolutely brilliant,"I have to admit that i'm not a big fan of tasting menus, especially the surprise kind, so took a risk booking a table here for Boxing Day evening. Finding the restaurant wasn't easy, it's not in the best part of Amsterdam, and the signage is minimal, minimal. However once inside it quickly became evident that this was going to be a great experience. The place was buzzing, very informal, with lovely friendly staff who explained everything fantastically. We plumbed for the 'basic' five course menu, with an extra option of oysters that were out of this world. You also get an amuse bouche, so really our 5 courses were 7. Every course was exceptional, explained by the wonderful staff. This should be added to everyones must visit."
d7689983,January 2020,50,We ate chefs tasting menu,"We ate chefs tasting menu (5-7course) for lunch and it was a fantastic experience. We had table at the bar and enjoyed it. Clearly that the chefs play with textures, colors and flavors to put together dishes in a interesting way and it made us very curious. Salty pumpkin dessert was one of the highlights."
d7689983,December 2019,10,"Having reserved at lunchtime,","Having reserved at lunchtime, there was no record of it on arrival.  The concept is interesting, but food just ‘confusing.’ The staff didn’t seem to know how to explain it either. They didn’t seem to know much about the wine list either, and what went best with what etc...  The delicate taste of mussels was completely obscured by the strong, overwhelmingly powerful coriander ‘soup’ which the said mussels appeared to be swimming in. What a disastrous pairing!  It was an interesting ‘experience’; very pretty etc, but not a place I’d rush back to for the food, put it that way.  Better places to go world round."
d7689983,November 2019,50,Wonderful Dinner with our Family,We loved this fabulous restaurant. The food was amazing. Beautifully presented and wonderful flavors using the freshest ingredients. The service was wonderful too. The restaurant was also able to prepare a beautiful white fish for our 6 and 8 year old that they loved.
d7689983,November 2019,50,Warm atmosphere and tasty food,We had a lovely dinner at restaurant GUTS. Despite having an early dinner slot we were not rushed during our time in the restaurant. The staff were great; everyone was helpful and very friendly throughout. The 5 course Chef's menu had flavourful dishes with good quality ingredients. The dessert was divine (the best part of the meal).  Would definitely visit again.
d7689983,November 2019,50,Five Star Evening,"GUTS was our favorite dinner out during a recent trip to Amsterdam. Five stars on all elements --> the cozy space, friendly and informative staff, and the FOOD (!) was fabulous. Creative presentation only enhanced the high quality ingredients. They also flawlessly accommodated a member of our party with a NG dietary request. Would definitely recommend and return on our next visit!"
d7689983,November 2019,30,"Great food and staff, but extremely small portions. Overpriced.","It is a nice restaurant and I would have given it a higher rating if I did not feel slightly ripped off. The food was nice and original and some interesting great wines in the pairing menu. The staff was friendly and pleasant. But the portions were tiny, especially the main course which consisted of 1 tiny slice of wild duck and a bit of beetroot. 3 or 4 slices would have been nice and perhaps something a little more substantial to go with it than a small bite of beetroot?    I do not eat huge amounts of food, but this was simply not sufficient.    In hindsight we should have ordered some bread to go with it ( this was charged extra which I find ridiculous by the way) but since we had some nachos in a nearby cafe before dinner we were worried it would be too much. Considering we planned to eat 5 courses.    It is not just that I was still a little bit hungry when I got home, I also feel overcharged for wat it was."
d3589514,July 2022,50,Nice casual spot for Delicious Thai,"Excellent service, delicious food and great prices. We walked up on this place and were pleasantly surprised with the entire experience. Great place for a good, easy meal. We will be back!"
d3589514,April 2022,50,Definitely worth a visit! Super delicious!,"Super nice staff and service, very polite! :) Food was served quickly and tasted super delicious! They have a great variety of dishes and a good price range. My family and I loved it, I definitely recommend a visit!"
d3589514,November 2021,50,Delicious,What a lovely place! Easy to miss but totally worth it when you find it. Authentic Thai food. Tom kha was delicious. Everything looked so goood. Will totally visit again.
d3589514,November 2021,50,Revitalise your palate at this great Thai!,"This small restaurant is easy to be missed, but the food is outstanding.  Monday night was quite but the welcome was warm-hearted. The owner and his wife run the restaurant and stir in the pans.    The restaurant is relatively simple. The menu has a lot of variety and the prices are very reasonable. Main courses for about 15€.    Food quality was outstanding. Really nice flavours. Spicy, creamy, aromatic….jummy!  Everything is freshly prepared at your order."
d3589514,November 2021,50,Everything perfect!,The staff was super friendly and the food was super good as well! Little restaurant with amazing atmosphere in the center of Amsterdam!
d3589514,September 2021,50,"Good thai food, but small portions","This place serve good thai food, but the portions is quite small. The service is friendly. The rice could have been cooked better."
d3589514,February 2020,40,Great food and very friendly,Great food and very friendly staff. Chicken satay and chicken in red curry sauce were delicious. Very nice. Restaurant is a little tight when crowded.
d3589514,February 2020,50,Excellent food lovely staff,Food was delicious and the staff were friendly and helpful. It was good value. I would highly recommend it
d3589514,December 2019,40,Best Thai food I've ever had!,"We just happened upon this little restaurant while meandering around and it looked cozy. It's very small but wow, such great food! The service was wonderful and friendly and everything we ordered was so delicious. Definitely want to return here for another meal."
d3589514,December 2019,50,Delicious authentic Thai food.,Delicious authentic Thai food. The staff and owner are super welcoming and friendly. Great atmosphere and I enjoyed a lot the time yum soup and panaeng chicken.
d3589514,December 2019,50,Delicious authentic food,We were 5 having all different dishes and everyone was amazed. Every dish was totally authentic and fast prepared. I absolutely recommend this place.
d3589514,November 2019,40,Good Thai food for a good price,"The service is very good and friendly. The food is very good, not Thai spicy but a bit spicy. The price is very good, not expensive. We’ve eaten here a few times and keep coming back. The fish cookies are very good."
d3589514,October 2019,50,Seriously Good!,"Read the reviews, so we went, and we loved it!    Really small place, expect to cozy up to other diners if there’s just two of you! Doesn’t look like much, but the food is seriously good.    Both had soups to start, both so tasty and fresh. Then one veggie main and a prawn main, both came with boiled rice. Honestly, so good. Really fresh ingredients and amazing flavours.    The service was great, we asked the guy for his recommendations and he helped us choose to our tastes.    I have a feeling we might eat here again before we leave!!!!"
d3589514,October 2019,50,Amazing Thai dinner and gluten free,"We decided to have an early dinner on Thursday in our one night in Amsterdam and give this restaurant a go. We were so pleased we did. From the moment we entered we experienced friendly and helpful service. We eat gluten free food....me because I have to and my husband because he supports me when eating out!...the staff were very helpful and understanding and there was very little I could not have. I had red thai curry, my husband had the green Thai curry...the food was amazing...best Thai we have eaten in a very long time..and washed down with a bottle of Vina Sol, which is one of our favourites...we found it was really good value for money too...we had such a great meal we tried to return for lunch the next day before we left Amsterdam, but unfortunately they were not open until 3pm...we highly recommend this lovely small restaurant...."
d3589514,September 2019,10,Extremely rude waitress; left and ate at Baibua Thai Eethuis around the corner (Geelsteegvinckssteeg 6H),"On a rainy Saturday evening, my wife and 3-year-old daughter were caught in the rain without any umbrella as the forecast for the day was meant to be warm, sunny weather without rain. It was close to 7 p.m. so we decided we might as well already have dinner and hopefully wait out the rain. My wife was carrying our 3-year-old daughter as she neither wanted to sit in her stroller nor walk.    We entered the restaurant and informed the Asian-looking waitress that we wanted a table for 3. She was speaking with the guests sitting at a table by the entrance. We waited a few minutes. We could not go further into the restaurant as our stroller could not fit into the space between tables without the waitress moving aside.    The waitress's colleague (or perhaps the owner - a tall white man, presumably Dutch( by the counter inside the restaurant already motioned us to a table inside. We politely said ""Pardon"" (what you would say in Dutch) to the waitress so she could move aside to let us through. Instead, she shot us an irritated look and muttered that she was still talking to the guests.    We entered the restaurant, and seated ourselves at a table. The waitress went to the kitchen and was angrily relaying the incident to her Asian colleague.    My wife and I then realised there was no point in continuing to have dinner at this restaurant and have dinner in such an unpleasant environment. We decided that we weren't going to spend our money on this restaurant whose waitress was so rude and inconsiderate. I pointed out to her that it was a very simple matter to have let us through without incident, and she could continue speaking to the other customers. Instead, she preferred that we just stand there unnecessarily for a long time, while my wife continued to carry our daughter. It also wasn't very busy yet, as we had arrived before 7 p.m.    For a restaurant serving cuisine from the Land of Smiles, this waitress needs to undergo Hospitality 101.    Fortunately, this part of Amsterdam is full of Thai restaurants, and we ate at Baibua Thai Eethuis around the corner on Geelsteegvinckssteeg 6H. We enjoyed our meal there and were glad that we had salvaged what would have been a miserable evening."
d4173529,May 2022,50,Great breakfast place,"We went here for breakfast in the De Pijp neighborhood. The food was really healthy and really good. It's also vegetarian and vegan friendly with many options for both. The key to this place, because it is sort of small, is to get there 10-15 minutes before it opens. There is usually a line outside before the doors officially open, and if you get there later, you should expect waiting a while for a table."
d4173529,November 2022,50,So Good I/We Visited Six Times in One Trip,"During our recent week-long visit to Amsterdam, my wife and I strove to try someplace different each day for breakfast, using a variety of recommendation resources to zero in on something walkable from our hotel in Amsterdam—Oost.    We were well-rewarded in our choice of Bakers and Roasters. In fact, after my wife departed and I continued the trip for business, I went back another five times.    The staff is warm and welcoming; the service is very attentive without being hovering or annoying; and the food looks, smells, and tastes delicious.    On our first visit, I ordered the unique, delicious, and notable Banana Nut Bread French Toast and my wife, the B & R Special with sourdough bread and a poached egg. Both were outstanding. On the subsequent five visits, I did the B & R Special with variations on the egg, trying both scrambled and fried. Again, both combinations were delicious.    The wait and line here is frequently long and was every time I/we visited, except for a mid-week morning when I showed up at opening. Be prepared to wait and to use their Dojo-based add-yourself-to-the-wait-queue-with-a-QR-code service. Rest assured, it's worth it!"
d4173529,October 2022,50,Premium Experience!,Amazing visit; incredibly friendly staff who go out of their way to make you feel special and well looked after. Beautiful food and fantastic coffee. Can I add any more superlatives?? Premium experience. Thank you!
d4173529,September 2022,50,Best granola ever!!,"Our hotel did not offer breakfast and quite a few places do not open until 10am for breakfast.  This restaurant is down a side street and was already very busy when we arrived just after 8.30.  The coffee was v good. My husband had' Eggs Benny',which he said was excellent. The home made granola was absolutely delicious. Portions are generous-I had been considering having Eggs Benny as well,but am glad that I just had the granola-it was more than enough.  Service was cheerful and very efficient,but we didn't feel as if we were being rushed"
d4173529,August 2022,10,"rude staff, not worth the otherwise good food","we had been there the day before, food good, and a nice experience, so the next day we went again, but inexplicably, the hostess was EXCEPTIONALLY RUDE. She treated us like we had offended her in some way, did not smile or even acknowledge us for a long while. Threw menus on the table and walked away. No idea why we were treated this way! we waited about 15 minutes and no wait staff even approached the table. they ignored us completely, and made us feel very unwelcome! So we left. It was a very bad experience. The food is good, but nobody should be treated this way! there are many other places around there with good food and nice people. Skip Bakers and Roasters, not worth it!"
d4173529,August 2022,50,Delicious breakfast and great,"Delicious breakfast and great staff. Great variety, all so different to everywhere else we went. We had the full vegan and everything was so tasty! You can’t book online, so there’s a bit of a wait when you get there, but food is so good it’s worth a visit!"
d4173529,August 2022,50,Delicious food and incredible coffee,"I have no words for how delicious the food was and the staff was attentive and helpful and the coffee was perfect, A+++"
d4173529,July 2022,50,Unbelievably good vegan breakfast,"Unbelievably good vegan breakfast. Amazing flavours and very decent portions.    Mushrooms in cashew cream were brilliant. We normally dread the scrambled mess but here the texture, temperature and taste were all bang on.    They didn't (thankfully) have any vegan cheese so they substituted spinach which worked in our favour reducing the processed food count!    Can we suggest adding mushrooms on toast to your vegan options?"
d4173529,July 2022,50,Great service and good food,"Join the online waiting list - they are quite busy, but worth the wait.    When we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly hostess. The service throughout our brunch was great - regardless of who we talked to. Everyone was friendly, even though they were quite busy.    I am always hesistant to order cappuccinos because you never know if you get a blob of boiled milk on bitter, sour espresso, or a silky smooth foam with a high quality espresso. This place had one of the best cappuccinos I’ve ever had. Perfect microfoam, perfect temperature, balanced and no need to sweeten with sugar.    I also ordered a bloody mary - and it was well balanced and delicious.    The eggs royale were a treat. The salmon was light, the eggs perfectly poached and the hollandaise fluffy, airy and balanced. It’s actually quite impressive that they managed to make a meal with so much fat taste so light and fresh.    The portions are large, and the prices are extremely good as well."
d4173529,July 2022,50,Simply perfect,"The perfect blend of atmosphere, exceptionally friendly service & delicious food. Definitely try the kombucha."
d4173529,June 2022,50,Lovely breakfast and staff,"It was our first breakfast in Amsterdam and it was a great start to our stay! The food, place and staff are great. Lovely, cheerful staff! Varied and interesting menu, efficient service and also a great morning playlist :) Totally recommended!"
d4173529,June 2022,50,Delicious brunch,What a fabulous cappuccino with a brunch. I had the scrambled egg option with avocado. The staff were friendly and attentive. Highly recommended.
d4173529,June 2022,50,Yummy breakfast,"Great breakfast food. Prepare to wait a little longer than usual as they are a busy spot but well worth the wait. Staff was nice, coffee/latte was so good. Food portions are large and delicious."
d4173529,June 2022,50,Fabulous,"We discovered this amazing place when searching for our first brunch in Amsterdam yesterday and loved it so much we returned today with our son. Fabulous fresh healthy food, a good menu and really friendly service. A bit of a queue to get in, but that shows just how good it is. I have no hesitation in recommending this place. I’m not going to describe the food I had - go and see for yourself."
d4173529,June 2022,50,Best breakfast,"The best breakfast in Amsterdam, you will not be disappointed. We kept coming back and were only visiting for a few days. I'd have to hunt far and wide for a breakfast burrito and fluffier Pancakes like that."
d6418254,November 2022,40,"Good food, terribly long wait for food","This place was recommended by our hotel for good Chinese food. It was good, but we waited an hour for our food to arrive (and I mean our appetizer!). The egg rolls were tasty and the beef prepared with sweet and sour sauce was delicious. The very long wait did leave a bit of a bad taste in our mouths though, especially since it was a Wednesday night."
d6418254,October 2022,50,Excellent restaurant,Beautiful and clean place. Excellent food and attention. The roasted duck is highly recommended. We celebrated a birthday and they gave us a candle. We really enjoyed our lunch here
d6418254,October 2022,40,"Cheap look, high price but great food",Really a great food experience....pity that the place the porcelain and cutlery are really cheap! If I pay 100 euro per head I expect a great ambient too....so they should invest on assets too. But the food is fantastic
d6418254,October 2022,50,Fresh dishes packed full of flavour,"Authentic cuisine, very fresh dishes with tender meat.  The spicy 3 dishes are really hot but wort it.  Full of flavour, would recommend!"
d6418254,October 2022,40,"food great, service slow",food was great but service was slow. Would recommend. Place is busy but still pleasant . Presentation of food was excellent.
d6418254,October 2022,50,Excellent Quantity and Taste,"Excellent food. Great taste and very good quantity.    We ordered Sui Kau Soup, Dry Chilli chicken and Prawn and Pork Nasi Goreng Fried rice"
d6418254,September 2022,50,Good Chinese restaurant on main street,"Nice place along the main Street of Amsterdam. They don't allow reservation you need to jump in and make queue. But it was plenty of Chinese and food was really nice. Duck, shrimps, beef and pork. Original chinese taste"
d6418254,August 2022,20,Beware,"I say beware because of a few reasons- the ordering from an iPad is not a nice experience and separates you from your service and in turn, your experience/explanations  Secondly, it is cash only  Next, we found it very expensive  And finally, do not have the Dry Friend Prawn dish unless you love spicy sour food"
d6418254,July 2022,50,Awesome taste!,Absolute delicious. We order the half of duck with roasted green beans and fried rice - 1 portion of each is more then enough for 2-3 persons. Totally recommend it if you are in Amsterdam
d6418254,June 2022,50,Fabulous,"We arrived from England and decided to try this restaurant after reading the reviews .    We all agreed it’s on e of the best Chinese restaurants we have eaten in . Food was brilliant and we loved it .    The only thing I didn’t like were the menus on iPads , because I hate technology .    Other than that superb!!"
d6418254,June 2022,10,Celebratory birthday meal,"Extremely disappointed with our experience at this restaurant. At around 100 euros for 2 courses a bowl of rice and one of the cheapest bottles of wine (38 euoros) on the menu I expected that the food would be exquisite and the service first class, in both cases they fell way short of the mark.  The food was well cooked and acceptable but be warned; some menu items have so much chilli they are inedible as with the shredded beef dish I ordered, had there been sufficient warning that it was likely to set fire to your tongue on impact I would not have ordered it! As it was at the very least I would have expected a pair of gloves to be served to enabling getting said food from plate to mouth without incident!  When mentioning to the matre de our concerns that the dish was impossible to eat without distress she was surly in her response and offered a glass of tap water to help! ( I'm assuming it came out of the first aid kit!)  The waitress at our table offered a near incompetent service, starting with serving a different wine to that ordered (not even the right colour!) Then we having to settle for a bottle that was not of our choosing but at least this time the colour was right! I'm guessing she'd not been waitressing for very long and she wasn't to be blamed for being expected to serve so many tables. The restaurant was packed, poorly staffed, tables crammed together like a street food hall in Beijing. I won't be going back."
d6418254,June 2022,50,Authentic Szechuan Food,"We had pork with chilli fungu and celery, fine beans, noodles and chicken with chilli. Absolutely delicious. Presentation of food the dishes beautiful, including jasmine tea which was served in a glass pot on top of a warmer. Service was excellent. The Manager was very professional polite and helpful."
d6418254,May 2022,50,The reviews are right,"Excellent service and great food. The presentation, the taste, the taste! The portions were large and absolutely amazing. We called ahead to see if they took reservations, they don't. However, they remembered I called and sat our kids and us quite shortly despite the line when I arrived."
d6418254,May 2022,50,One of the best Sichuan cuisine in Amsterdam,"After a long day work came to this restaurant with friends, they got us the big table and everyone is so nice and warm, the service is perfect.  Then the dishes are just perfect, we ordered a lot of meat dishes and none of them are bad. My favorite is the spicy chicken, super tasty, not too spicy just proper. If you into traditional Sichuan Chinese delish, this is the one."
d6418254,May 2022,50,Spicy and delicious,Loved all of it. Can be a bit too spicy for some people. But if you love and know Asian cuisine it is the best choice for a dinner.
d10247215,October 2022,50,Impeccably fresh fish and great atmosphere - a must visit during any trip to Amsterdam,"My wife and I visited Pesca on Thursday 28 October during our long weekend stay in Amsterdam. I always read reviews but rarely write them but thought Pesca definitely warrants one as not only is it very good but also there aren't many current reviews plus the format of the restaurant is very different so no doubt like me you have plenty of questions before you join.    Firstly, I read a review saying that ther restaurant is hard to find. That simply is not true - it is on a street with a number of the most popular restaurants in Amsterdam and then the restaurant name 'Pesca' is literally lit up in large lights on the outside of the building.    We arrived and check in with the booking desk. It was quite busy so we were asked to wait at the bar and order a drink. Two very small gripes here. Firstly, I had hard reports of people being offered a glass of prosecco and at the booking desk there were a number of bottles but alas we weren't offered one. Secondly there is a large popcorn booking machine by the booking desk with small metal buckets of popcorn. Again we weren't offered this (although admittedly the popcy may have just been for children).    Anyways once it was our turn to choose our fish we were taken over to the fresh fish table by a friendly waiter/fishmonger who spoke perfect English. The daily prices of the fish were on a dynamic price board and he asked us questions about the fish we liked.    We ended up choosing: oysters and picked salmon to start then chose Octopus, Monkfish, Makerel and Soft Shell Crab for our main dishes together with green salad and fries for our sides. We really enjoyed the experience and our waiter actually stopped is from choosing more fish as said we had ordered enough for two people.    We then went over to the wine selection and talked to the sommelier. Given that we went with a meaty fish like Monkfish which would be cooked in an Asian coconut sauce, we wanted a relatively full flavoured white wine so went with a Chardonnay. There were a number of options ranging from a price point of €30 up to €90.    Once sat at out table we waited for our food to be freshly cooked and it didn't disappoint.    We had the oysters and pickled salmon to start. Both very nice and probably up there with the best oysters we have ever had.    We then had the Octopus and Soft Shell Crab. Again, really enjoyed both of them. The octopus was very simple fish but was the best dish of the night. Cooked perfectly with the outside grilled so that it had caramelized whilst the rest of the meat was perfectly tender.    We then had our Monkfish and Makeral. The Monkfish was very substantial and meaty in a lovely fresh asain cocoi nut sauce and a soya sauce glaze.    The sides were very delicious too especially the green side salad which had a nice zesty dressing.    Oddly we weren't offered/given any bread for our table yet did see other tables get bread.    The total price for our meal including our wine and pre-drink at the bar (but not including service/tip) was €135 which we both thought was really reasonable given how good the food and overall experience was. The format of the restaurant is such a good idea and be great if the concept makes its way over to the UK.    In conclusion, believe the hype- Pesca is that good and you'll have a great time eating impeccably fresh fish."
d10247215,September 2022,20,Allergy ignored,"We visited Pesca hoping for a unique experience which we did receive. We were greeted with Cava and chose our dishes where I mentioned I had a nut allergy. No further questions were asked. We then received our starter which was nice. We then received our main and I noticed a nutty smell on the fish accompanied with flecks of what we now know was peanuts. I alerted the staff of this and asked them to check if the dish contained nuts, they then confirmed this and apologised and offered to make a new dish. I declined the offer as I now had lost trust in my dishes having nuts in. When paying they took of my meal. I would advise if you have an allergy to double check or really emphasise it as it can truly be a life or death matter."
d10247215,October 2022,30,Exhausting,Came here based on great reviews and our love of seafood …  In theory good concept  However in practice exhausting and stressful …which could be easier by just been given a menu !!  Negatives  Queuing for the fish counter ..  We had an indecisive chatty couple in front who took 20 minutes to decide … then there was the wine market … totally unnecessary .. a simple wine list would be for more efficient …  I shared Tables at the edge … where extremely high seated and difficult to access  Once you have done the pre dining process and finally started to relax the food was very good indeed  But the same results could have been achieved and a relaxed dining experience with a menu  I would not recommend or return  I still have PTSD …
d10247215,October 2022,50,"Lively fish resturant in a converted cinema, with great food and staff.","Our top meal in foody Amsterdam. You start by selecting your fresh fish at the ‘market’ front of house before you pair it with wines you can sample. Great selection of langustines, softshell crab, mussels, scallops, crevettes, mackerel, bream, squid, tuna and grouper. Sides are kept simple: skin-on chips and courgettes with asparagus and tomatoes. The food arrived in waves once it was cooked, so it became a sort of tasting menu. Excellent cooking and flavours all round: the Mexican tuna was notably gorgeous, subtely spiced and meltingly fresh. Mackerel tasty too, with its blistered skin. We shared two indulgent puddings to round things off nicely.  There’s a great atmosphere with varied seating in a large stylish dining room and affable, attentive staff. Including service and a bottle of fruity French Chardonnay, the bill for two came to 160 Euros."
d10247215,October 2022,50,Awesome experience,Very different experience in Amsterdam. Quality fish and great drinks. We like the set up and the way they guide you through the restaurant (although there were some very slow people choosing their drinks in front of us). The tuna was outstanding and we sole we chose was also amazing!!! We’d go back!
d10247215,October 2022,50,Good fish an unique experience,"It was a unique experience. We chose our fishes like from a market, not a menu, and then they recommended wines that go with it. Prices were surprisingly affordable for Amsterdam and the quality of food and ambiance.  Make sure to reserve a table online, because it is very full. Also it will charge 10 euros/person, but you get the money back when you pay!"
d10247215,October 2022,40,Great Seafood Experience,"1st time travelers to Amsterdam and we wanted a great seafood restaurant. PESCA did not disappoint. The bar experience was amazing as their cocktail preparation was a nice show in and of itself. Then we were summoned to the seafood market... so many choices and too little time. After our selections we went to the wine venue and selected a superb Sancerre to go with our selections. We had oysters as a starter then fried scallops and grilled octopus as seconds and finally a preparation of Monkfish to die for. Their veggie side dishes were fresh and complemented the meal. The only negative (if there is one) is that it is a large, crowded and noisy atmosphere; very casual. This is not white tablecloth eating."
d10247215,September 2022,50,where to start.,"this place is seafood heaven..it is so different then any restaurant..upon entering you are given a glass of proseco and asked to wait until you are called to pick out your meal from the display case which is about 20 feet long filled with all sorts of seafood.they call you up to the case and explain how this works, explain all the different seafoods and you pick the ones you want...all by weight, as much as you want and which ever ones you want..it is weighted by grams and they prepare it the way they want.you can choose side dishes. then they show you to your table.the food comes out as it is ready and no special order, great food, fun and wonderful experience."
d10247215,October 2022,50,"Delicious food, great concept!","We came here for lunch on a Saturday and had one of the best meals of our trip. The concept it great - you go to the fish counter and choose a variety of fish, all of which is shared between your table, cooked in different ways. We had some cured salmon to start followed by Calamari and Scallops and finishing off with monk fish. All of it was outstanding. We got some chips on the side which were also delicious.  Great selection of wines too - we enjoyed a French Sauvignon blanc.  Don't come here if you don't like fish!!"
d10247215,October 2022,50,Wonderful dinner!,"The meal model was interesting where we ordered the seafood from a ""market stall"" within the restaurant, make our way through a wine and drinks station to get our drinks and finally settle down at our table and wait for what we ordered to be cooked and served.    The food was simply ""lekker"" (Dutch for delicious and yummy). Service was super."
d10247215,October 2022,30,True fish lovers beware,"Pesca has a nice atmosphere and a fun dinning experience where they talk you through the different fish options. If you are looking for a trendy place with a different dinning experience this is the place. But if you are a true fish lover you will probably be disappointed, although they had really nice fresh fish, most of our dishes were murdered by overcomplicated sauces that just did not compliment the fish... No dish was exceptional and for the price paid it was a total disappointment. On the other side the wine and oysters were excellent. We will not be back here again."
d10247215,September 2022,50,Great food and atmosphere,We had a fun time picking our fresh seafood and then being amazed at what the kitchen did with our choices. Seafood is fresh and expertly prepared. Staff is friendly and attentive. A must for your next trip to Amsterdam.
d10247215,October 2022,50,Great experience,We had the opportunity to eat dinner at Pesca. Great experience and delicious food ! We were celebrating the end of our Trip to Europe and it was amazing. The concept of choosing from the fish market and then receiving it cooked at your table is excellent. Thank you !
d10247215,September 2022,30,One person let the whole team down. The foul mouthed and immature wine person left a sour taste and tainted the evening,"The concept is great, ambience is smashing, the fish and complimentary dishes perfectly matched . The mackerel,in particular was devine. A fun place to eat, really tasty food.  All let down by the rudest of wine ""experts"". He greeted us by trying to mimic our accents, his sentences were peppered with the foulest language. I think he the thinks he's funny. He's not! When I challenged this approch, his response was ( in an attempted Scottish accent with the F word liberally interspersed between those few words ) "" all Scottish people swear all the time""  They don't and we aren't Scottish.  This person let all his colleagues down with his obnoxious and immature behaviour. What a shame"
d10247215,September 2022,50,Amazing experience,"Amazing experience. Would recommend to any fish lovers. Staff were lively and the whole experience was great, would recommend but book in advance."
d1232530,September 2022,40,First day's dinner,"Was staying in Raadhuisstraat nearby. Wandered the narrow streets between Jordaan and Westermarkt, to find this Lonely Planet recommended bar and restaurant. Bar staff friendly and venue was welcoming. Sat inside at the bar, as it was chilly outside, and all the tables were occupied. Varied menu and some specials available too. Had the fish special, and that was excellent, very tasty. Great atmosphere here too. Shame that I only had 2 days in Amsterdam."
d1232530,September 2022,50,Amazing restaurant,"Really nice restaurant with excellent staff, great food. The meat and fish were prepared well and it was really delicious. Not so far from the city center"
d1232530,August 2022,40,nice experience,"good food and fine staff. Not so chip, but experience so nice. A good menu, Nice place in nice street"
d1232530,June 2022,10,Canceled our reservation with no notice,"They absolutely bailed on our reservation.    I left a voice mail March 24 per their instructions to call in for a reservation and received the following text:    Thank you for the reservation in hun 17th 7 guests. Wat time do you want to come? Gr. Han van de Heron    I replied June 17 for 7 people at 7:00 pm. Thank you!! Lots of 7’s!    As you can imagine traveling with 7 of us it is difficult to just walk in for dinner so I made reservations well in advance.    I reconfirmed the reservation the day before our dinner and received Hoi Mindy, we are full tonight. Gr. Han.    I sent them the original response that we were booked and asked them to honor and they said    Hoi Mindy, yes too bad, we Woul have liked it differently have a Nice time, gr. Han    Incredibly rude and unprofessional. We were left having to scramble for dinner after planning 2 months in advance."
d1232530,May 2022,50,Best in Amsterdam,"I came with my niece from Croatia and we stayed for a week in Amsterdam. This was best place we visited. Very nice food, friendly staff,we had lot of fun and had a great time. Thanks one more time"
d1232530,May 2022,50,Great gastropub.,Great gastropub restaurant. Super fresh ingredients. Menu. is small but augmented by daily specials. Kind of a happening place Word has clearly got out this is a must visit restaurant in Amsterdam. Really nice normal visit be. If I lived in Amsterdam I would eat here on a very regular basis
d1232530,April 2022,50,Don’t miss this restaurant,"Fantastic in all ways: ambiance, friendliness? Food, drinks. We had sea bass with limoncello sauce, delicious. There is a pub like atmosphere that makes you happy to be there. We will definitely go back!"
d1232530,April 2022,50,"Quaint Pub, Great Food and Service","We dined here our first night on the recommendation of a guidebook and our hotel. We were not disappointed. The restaurant is on a quiet side street and has a quaint pub atmosphere. Service was excellent.    I had a great lamb dish and my wife had the monkfish. Both were very good, but save room for the apple tartin (caramelized torte) with ice cream. Delicious! Like all restaurants in Amsterdam, the tables are close together, so enjoy meeting those at the next table!    I would hghly recommend this spot."
d1232530,April 2022,40,With charm,"Popular and very cozy restaurant. Well cooked dishes and very good raw material. The portions are not very plentiful, but for dinner, correct. The fish was very fresh."
d1232530,July 2020,50,Everything great,Excellent service and great food. Perfect place and cute street. We will definitely make it a favourite
d1232530,July 2020,50,Very good mussels and service,The mussels i had were really really good and the staff is friendly and fast. The place is very cozy. Strongly recommended!
d1232530,January 2020,40,Tasty food & a very nice cat,We had dinner a couple of times at De Reiger while we were in Amsterdam. The beer list included a very nice IPA. We especially like the sea bass. The service was friendly and efficient. And we really liked that Binky (the resident cat) decided to spend a bit of time with us.
d1232530,January 2020,40,Good food/cool cat 🐈,The food was delish and the restaurant was cozy. Mustard soup was fantastic and my husband enjoyed the duck app with the goose leg dinner special. Thoroughly enjoyed!
d1232530,December 2019,50,Hearty and delicious,Another ridiculously good review. We have been lucky in our dining choices here. De Reiger seems to specialize in game and stews. The lamb roulade was wonderfully lamby. My son had a dish of duck legs that had pellets in it. Now that’s real game! The mussels were perfectly cooked and an enormous portion. Small menu stuffed with things they know they do well. Very reasonable prices. Great choice for a hearty dinner.
d1232530,November 2019,40,A welcoming pub restaurant,"Visited twice when on a 4 day break in Amsterdam. Food was Dutch, beautifully cooked and presented. The staff were friendly and attentive and the atmosphere was casual, busy and welcoming."
d697036,November 2022,50,Tasty and traditional!,Amazing food and stuff! The food was really tasty and the stuff very friendly and fun! I recommend! Try the chicken satay and the bitterballen!
d697036,July 2022,50,"Great Food, Great Service, Great Value","When we got to The Pantry, we beat the crowds and were able to get a lovely table outside the café. Within half an hour the place was packed, and there were no tables available inside or outside. We got there about 4 pm on...More"
d697036,October 2022,50,Tucked away little gem of a restaurant...,"Fabulous family hosts, excellent quality superb Dutch food at reasonable price. Would highly recommend and I certainly will visit again when I am next in Amsterdam."
d697036,November 2022,50,Great intro to the Dutch cuisine,"It was difficult to secure a reservation but now I understand why. It is truly a wonderful restaurant with great staff and friendly service.  At times you wonder 'a Dutch traditional cuisine' may mean a tourist trap. And indeed when you get there you see 'typically Dutch' decor and a bit old-looking thick menu in multiple languages. However, when your food arrives and as you interact more with the staff, you understand the great attention to details they put in all their dishes (and we ordered 10+ dishes!) and above all, the team's overall good humour and hospitality that are coherent across all our interactions with the service staff.  This is a great intro to the Dutch cuisine as well as the Dutch hospitality, and I would gladly return for more!"
d697036,November 2022,50,"Delicious food, fabulous service","I know why there is a line outside this restaurant and why people are willing to wait for a table. The restaurant is tiny, but they fit as many people as possible inside. You never feel rushed to leave your table, even though it is always busy. The food is delicious, home style food similar to foods my mother would make. The staff is all friendly and serve with a smile. They are very interested in your enjoyment and make sure you have everything you need. I wish I could have tried multiple dishes, but the Bitterballen, the meat and onion stew and the hutspot were all delicious. We left a bag behind and they ran out after us, but we were too fast. We realized afterward and made the walk back and they kept the bag safe for us. I can't recommend this place enough."
d697036,October 2022,50,Great food and ambiance,"Felt very Dutch to me. Kudos to the entire team.. You all provided great service , good Dutch food and hospitality."
d697036,October 2022,30,Good home cooked food with friendly service,Dutch specialties with lost of potatoes. Good Indonesian satay chicken though it would be better served with rice than the cold salads on the plate. The pea soup is delicious (cut the bacon served on the side and put it in the soup).
d697036,October 2022,50,Great food and really friendly staff,"Ate here on the first night of our stay and wish I had booked it for the other 2 nights! Really friendly staff, relaxed atmosphere and the food was spot on"
d697036,October 2022,50,Great Dutch Dinner!,"This small place packs a punch! They have it all....service was kind and friendly, food was delicious and the atmosphere was bright and lively! Had a great night and enjoyed everything! Thank you!"
d697036,September 2022,50,Excellent food and inexpensive prices,"I always do a lot of research before a trip. The rating for The Pantry is spot on. The food and service were excellent, and the cost was very reasonable. I had a local dish made up of mashed potatoes with carrots, and a large sausage. I don't remember what it was called, but it was excellent. Make reservations if you plan on eating here as it fills up very quickly. We will be back the next time we are in Amsterdam."
d697036,September 2022,50,Excellent local cuisine with very friendly staff,"I was skeptical about the local cuisine at first, but I was more than pleasantly surprised with how good the food was! The staff was great about recommending dishes and was very attentive. I would DEFINITELY recommend The Pantry!"
d697036,September 2022,50,A little gem with authentic Dutch cuisine,"Very authentic Dutch cuisine! Environment is very cozy and traditional decorated, staff are super friendly.  I was originally booked a table for 2, but had a friend to join us in the last minute. It’s fully booked online at that time slot and wouldn’t allow me to change. I arrived early to request a larger table, the staff was very helpful and problem solved.    Btw, there were 2 local ladies sat next to our table and we had a little chat. I believe if locals come, the food must be good!    Highly recommend this little gem to everyone!"
d697036,September 2022,50,"Wonderful Traditional Dutch Food, Amazing Service!!!","Absolutely fantastic food. Service was some of the best I’ve ever had. I have nothing but amazing things to say. A must try while in Amsterdam, especially if you want a truly Dutch experience. Will definitely return when I’m in Amsterdam again."
d697036,September 2022,50,Amazing Birthday Dinner,"We came here for my 21st birthday dinner and it couldn't have been any better - the service was fantastic, in particular Bas and Max, who conjured up some baby guinnesses having never heard of them before per my request (thank you!). The food was delicious, we highly recommend it to anyone wanting an affordable but special meal!"
d697036,September 2022,40,Perfect for traditional Dutch cuisine,A lovely traditional Dutch restaurant with great food! Staff were really accommodating and friendly. Highly recommend
d4007711,October 2022,50,Plush surroundings with good food,Really good food. Superb fish to start and mains beautifully cooked. Rose veal - a slightly over seasoned oregano jus. Good wine.
d4007711,September 2022,40,Its a nice restaurant,"The ambience is quite nice and the menu looks good. We had the steak for two which was nice but not great. The meat was surprisingly tough. But, overall, the meal was nice and would try again."
d4007711,September 2022,30,Nice decor but the rest is not memorable and service is too slow,Went for lunch as a family. Food choice is limited (think eggs and burgers) but pretty good ( not exceptional). Decor is great. Service is smily but not very professional and Extremely slow !
d4007711,July 2022,40,Lovely restaurant.,"Great atmosphere and service. As residents we enjoyed the best breakfasts we have ever eaten. Our evening meal was also superb because it combined very good food, excellent service, extremely good wine and a lovely atmosphere."
d4007711,July 2022,50,"Great place, great food, a must try","My friend and I recently visited The Lobby for dinner, and we were both amazed at the taste and quality of the food and the whole atmosphere. My friend had some herring tartare and some veal loin. I had a beef cheek rendang and some plaice filet and squid dish. All of which were incredibly delicious.  The place has a lovely cozy vibe.    The staff are funny, relaxed and very friendly, and very keen on making sure that you are happy for as long as you visit.  At one point they realized they had made an error in one of our orders and corrected it in just moments, completely of their own accord, as I hadn't even noticed the error myself :)    Don't be afraid to ask about cocktail recommendations as well. You are in for a treat. And perhaps a little story about the drink itself.  I had a ""Revive the Nanny"" cocktail, which apparently is their rendition of a favorite cocktail of Hemingway's.    I highly recommend it, and I will make sure to revisit whenever I am in Amsterdam again."
d4007711,July 2022,40,Cute Breakfast Place,Visited here for breakfast and sat on the patio to enjoy the sunshine. The food and coffee was great. Recommend the French Toast; it was delightful!
d4007711,July 2022,50,Your next lunch place,Awesome place. Super big place with great ambiance. Big menu with lots of choices. Gluten free bread! Would definitely recommend!!!
d4007711,June 2022,50,"Great Restaurant and patio, loved our experience","It’s a 5 out of 5. It was our first time in Amsterdam and we discovered this cozy restaurant which has left the best impressions! Hospitable hosts, delicious dishes, beautiful presentation, wide wine list, great service and wonderful dessert. The Pork Belly was fantastic, a must try. The Rhubarb desserts were amazing. I recommend to everyone! I would like to come back here again and again."
d4007711,April 2022,50,Incredible food!,"We went for my mums birthday, the menu was limited to one meat, fish or veggie option so the younger ones managed to get some food if the snack menu, chicken strips and chips and they loved it!  Even though it was limited the food was incredible!! I had the vegetarian option and it was full of flavour and i could eat it every day!!"
d4007711,April 2022,50,"Celebrated a special birthday in a special restaurant, with seasonal food - GO THERE","I found it difficult not to repeat my 5 star review of this hotel restaurant from nearly 3 years ago. The staff had changed and the menu had changed but it was still a fantastic , friendly experience with food that was truly amazing.    We were asked to confirm our booking about 2 hours before, but even so the staff remembered that the table was booked for a special birthday and welcomed us accordingly, with champagne (on the house)    The fixed price menu is competitively priced ( less than 40 euros per head) and the quality exceeds expectations for that price point. The food was amazing, delivering far more than the menu suggested, with bread and butter, with amazing spiced silverskin onions, free as an appetiser.    My starter was a really sumptuous piece of pork belly, so soft to eat, along with pink lightly pickled onions, shaved fennel and a garlic crisp which replicated pork crackling, along with a langoustine glaze at the edge.    Main meals were lamb 2 ways for one of us and a vegetarian terrine for the other. Both came really well presented and were of high quality. My lamb was sliced and served pink , but also there was column of well cooked tasty shredded lamb accompanied by asparagus and what i would call a pave of sliced and pressed potatoes, all really good with a small amount of sauce/gravy/jus , take your pick.    The vegetarian option came with an individual potato based terrine wrapped in seaweed and with broad beans, olives and a sauce choron- like a bearnaise sauce but with tomatoes added.    Desserts were a delightful combination of flavours, someone can really match ingredients at this place. My sable biscuit really lived up to its name, a sand like texture when cutting into it, and it went perfectly with the blueberry sorbet and chocolate mousse.    The other dessert of rhubarb, pink pepper meringue and rhubarb sorbet was delicious I'm told , but I didnt really pay it the attention it deserved - sorry.    Staff service was first class knowledgeable, caring, not too intrusive, glasses of water were refilled unobtrusively, AND lets not take for granted the perfect English spoken by the staff ."
d4007711,March 2022,10,Hostile service and vegans unwelcome,"This place has an elegant and cozy decor, nice atmosphere and tasty food. Sadly, this is all eclipsed amd spoiled by the hostile service rendered by our rude waitress.    Additionally, this place is NOT vegan friendly at all. Not only are there no vegan options on the menu, they would not consider replacing cheese with some vegan ingredient in order to ""veganize"" a vegetarian option. They would only omit the cheese altogether.    We will not be returning there."
d4007711,March 2022,30,So so la la,"I hate restaurants that serve a minuscule glass of wine! Our neighboring table thought the same!!!! Furthermore they forgot our first course, really?!?! The food was ok but if we return?!?!?"
d4007711,March 2022,50,YUM,"The atmosphere in here is really warm, cozy and chilled. The staff are friendly and welcoming and make great recommendations, and the food was AMAZING. I had a flammkuchen to start and the shrimp croquettes as a main, and my boyfriend had the shakshuka to start and the steak as a main. It was one of the best meals I’ve had in a long time. And also, the shakshuka was not overly tomato-ey, it had capsicum mixed through too, so even I (a hater of tomato) liked it a lot! I really recommend going here it is absolutely amazing"
d4007711,November 2021,50,Excellent - go,As opposed to our awful experience at de Luwte this was first class. Inventive well cooked food. Lovely atmosphere. Very very good young man waiting table happy to talk us through menus. Knowledgable and good humoured. They were running with 1/2 front of house staff but you wouldn’t know. A most excellent all round dining experience.
d4007711,September 2021,40,very cool courtyard,"Very cool courtyard to meet people for drinks and snacks, convivial and the staff are very friendly and accommodating."
d2076109,October 2022,40,Local restaurant & good local food,Small restaurant in a residential area. close to but not in the central area of Amsterdam with good local dutch food and great service. Busy and somewhat noisy. Simpel with wooden tables and chairs with dutch pictures and artifacts. Friendly staff.
d2076109,September 2022,50,Authentic Dutch Dining Experience,Perhaps the best food we had during our visit to Amsterdam. Wish we would have discovered it earlier in our trip as we would have dined there more than once.
d2076109,September 2022,50,Good local food,"Great local food ! The place is small so it is suggested to book in advance. Food very good, we tried the local dishes that are served also with vegetables. Also the desserts are tasty !"
d2076109,July 2022,50,A must in Amsterdam,We looked this place up when arriving to Amsterdam. We got there 16.50 (it opens at 17) and were lucky that we got a table. The food was delicios and you could really taste that it was made from scratch and that the restaurant is family owned since a long way back. The interiour makes you feel that you’re actually eating at someones home and the staff was very friendly. Would definately recommend!
d2076109,May 2022,50,DELISH!,"Fortunately my friend, who is a local, made reservations. The restaurant is small, but cozy and welcoming. Even though it was super busy, the service was top notch! I went with my friend's recommendation of the beef stew. It was delicious! The dessert was very good as well."
d2076109,June 2022,50,Authentic and Delicious!,"This restaurant came highly recommended so we thought we would give it a try. We were told if we didn’t get there early( 5pm) then to make a reservation. We got there at 5 pm and the place was already half full!( It is a small establishment) Anyway, I got the schnitzel w/mushroom sauce and fried potatoes. My husband got beef stew and boiled potatoes. It also came with 2 vegetables. The beef in the stew was so tender you could cut it with a fork and the sauce was unbelievably flavorful. The schnitzel was crispy and the mushroom sauce divine!! Just fantastic home cooked food at its finest! The desserts were all homemade as well!"
d2076109,May 2022,50,Cozy warm atmosphere with great comfort food and friendly staff,Authentic local restaurant with a cozy warm atmosphere and friendly staff. The food was great and probably the best meal of our trip. Don't miss eating here it was worth finding if you want to eat where the locals eat.
d2076109,May 2022,50,LOVED IT,"I was cold, hungry and I wanted to eat good food. Found this place and I was soo happy the food was good, portions large and the service great.. to visit it made me sooooo happy. And the price was really good. Totally loved it.."
d2076109,February 2022,50,Wonderful hidden gem,"We turned up on the off chance as l'd heard about it online. We always try and eat traditionally when we travel, and this was a great find. They fitted us in despite them obviously always being busy and us not having a reservation! The food was locally loved and very traditional, we could not fault it, and would of returned again on our visit, but like to try other places! Lovely helpful staff, thank you."
d2076109,October 2021,50,Dutch holiday,"Great home cooked dutch food! Went on a Thursday night. Served by two lovely waitresses, one in believe was family. Typical Dutch food. The only thing I'd say is that it's a shame not all the puddings are homemade. I had a souffle which was nice but you could tell it wasn't home cooked and the crepe suzette was uninspiring..."
d2076109,June 2021,50,Typical and good,This typical Dutch restaurant is so delicious! Food is tasty Andrew chicken and soup were incredible. Price is really low. I suggest this place to eat something good in Amsterdam
d2076109,February 2020,50,Really good honest Dutch food,"no frills, nothing fancy, not even a table cloth. But very tasty food in a busy popular restaurant, with generous portion sizes. We were there soon after 6pm and it filled up quite quickly after that. Service was quick and attentive: they probably rely on a good throughput of people. Great place."
d2076109,January 2020,50,Really lovely little dutch resturant,"Small restaurant in a quite street, very cosy inside. Had the beer chicken which was really nice, and I like that potatoes and veg are served in one separate bowl to your table and you can just help yourself! Staff were lovely too."
d2076109,January 2020,50,Nice dinner,"The experience was very nice. You can feel the local atmosphere as there are a lot of local clients. I have ordered an amazing mushroom soup, some baked chese with vegetables and my girfriend had Amsterdam chicken. Together with the drinks and desert we paid less than 50 e. We recommend this place to someone who want to eat good and spend some time with the locals."
d2076109,November 2019,50,Great Dutch food,We wanted to try some traditional Dutch food during our visit to Amsterdam and this place comes consistently high with TA reviews.    You cannot book which was a little off putting but on a Monday evening in November we only waited in line (inside) for less than ten minutes before we were invited to to sit down. Inside it was warm and every table was full. I started with the carpaccio and pesto which was a very generous starter. For main course I went for the pork and we managed to cram down a shared dessert with cherries before the restaurant closed promptly at 9.15pm.    The food was very good and served in generous portions and there was also a good range of local bottled beers. Service was friendly and there was a mix of local people and tourists which is always a good sign. The bill at the end of the evening was also a pleasant surprise!
d7837439,October 2022,50,Lovely place to eat.,"We ate here twice in our four days in Amsterdam. Service was friendly and helpful, atmosphere was good with lots of people (local and tourists) enjoying their evening. Fish and chips was excellent as was the salad. Prices were reasonable- the sharing platters are more expensive but look spectacular!"
d7837439,October 2022,50,"Premium restaurant ! Must in Amsterdam, fresh & delicious","Excellent. It was a good recommendation from our hotel. We were very surprised about the freshness of the seafood. Service was fantastic. Best of the night was Alex, our waiter. He recommended us the best seafood plate (mixed grill) and wine! You definitely have to visit this restaurant and have to meet Alex! His last name is timmerman"
d7837439,October 2022,50,Very Nice - bit pricey,"Food was excellent, a very enjoyable meal. Was a little pricey and maybe a bit understaffed (however if you read the news this is a problem across the industry) but a very tasty meal and the staff were very friendly. Would recommend"
d7837439,October 2022,50,The best place to eat seafood in Amsterdam,"A great variety of sea food. Very popular place. Book a table a couple of hours before visiting. Very good international wine list. Very friendly stuff, we were served by Michael and Freddy."
d7837439,October 2022,50,They do everything right!,"This is one of our favourite restaurants in Amsterdam. Every time we go, we have a great meal. When we booked (which is recommended), we asked for a particular area and we got a great table.    Service is polite, well-informed, prompt, friendly.    The food is just great - if you like fish and seafood! My favourite dish is the mixed seafood in pernod sauce.    We will come back soon, I think!"
d7837439,October 2022,30,"The whole thing was fantastic welcoming staff, very good advise for food and drinks but animals should not allowed",Fantastic resturant with excellent food but they allow dogs inside which immediately killed my wonderful experience
d7837439,September 2022,10,The Worst Service,"We were looking forward to a nice seafood meal after 12 hours of travelling. Sadly, it wasn't meant to be.    We were seated right away and greeted by our waitress. We placed our order for a couple glasses of wine, crab cake appetizer and a daily catch main and a salad. She brought our wine and the crab cakes promptly. The crab cakes were pasty and didn't appear very fresh. We have had much better.    We never saw that waitress again. We got a new waitress who then told us that the daily catch was no longer available and they would substitute halibut instead. We were fine with that. After waiting a half hour, she came back and said that our meals would be out shortly. After another 15 minutes, she said our mains would be out in 5 minutes. After another 15 minutes of waiting, now a whole hour, we asked that our bill be prepared as we were no longer interested in waiting. Our waitress had now moved on and we had a third staff member assist us to pay.    Their food may be ok, but their service is one of the worst experienced."
d7837439,March 2022,50,Excellent fish restaurant,Terrific fish restaurant serving excellent fresh seafood in modern setting with welcoming professional staff. Superb fish soup and oysters to start followed by fruits de merry platter - all excellent. Really good selection of white wines to accompany or a few reds if you prefer.
d7837439,September 2022,50,AMAZING,"Delicious meal from start to finish! The environment, the food and of course Jeroen took great care of us. It was our first here and we can't wait to come on back. Thank you!!"
d7837439,September 2022,50,Amazing evening,"We had a amazing evening, the food was perfect and Marjolein served us fabulous, thank you for the unforgetable experience ❤️❤️❤️"
d7837439,August 2022,50,From NYC to Amsterdam 💕,"My boyfriend and I came to dine at this restaurant and it was nothing short from AMAZING! From the ambiance to the food, everything was great. Our waiter Alberto was great too. We were informed of great things to do in Amsterdam & was very informative about our menu selection. Thank you for enhancing our experience. Would I come back again? Absolutely!    We had the seafood combo that included lobster, crab, shrimp, crawfish that tasted extremely fresh with the crab legs precut (loved that) with some amazing wine (that Alberto suggested). All definitely worth it & enough for two!"
d7837439,August 2022,50,Delicious seafood lunch! Ordered,Delicious seafood lunch! Ordered the Combination mix ánd finished it!;) Friendly personnel would recommend this restaurant! See you next time.
d7837439,August 2022,50,Dinner plater,"Excellent food at seafood bar Amsterdam. Very good food, and very helpful with gluten free requirements. Kitti was a great waitress. Thank you for a very enjoyable meal."
d7837439,August 2022,50,"Great service, top food","Great dorade and fish and chips, abundant portions and top quality. Service is attentive, honest and makes all the difference. Veronica was the best waitress ever, we will come back for sure"
d7837439,July 2022,30,Decent Seafood bar,We had a nice time here - the food was decent but the restaurant was very large and felt quite industrial. Nonetheless we had a nice time.
d8021047,October 2022,50,Good pizza and good vibes,Good pizza and good vibes. Seats around 22-25 people at once. The small seating area creates a good atmosphere. People were waiting outside in the rain to get in.
d8021047,September 2022,50,Simply Excellent,Simply excellent what else to add! of you want to enjoy a real italian restaurant managed by Italian - one of the best pizza in Amsterdam - La Zoccola is the place!
d8021047,September 2022,50,One of the best pizzas in Amsterdam!,"One of the best pizzas in Amsterdam. Very authentic and homey feel, friendly people, simple menu and good food!"
d8021047,July 2022,50,Lunch,Tasty pizza and great service! Restaurant is located near city center so you dont need to go far away for great pizza. You also need to try Italian craft beer.
d8021047,July 2022,40,Great pizza,Nice and very small restaurant in a side street in the center of Amsterdam. The restaurant is beautifully decorated. The pizzas are pretty huge with loads of ingredients on it.
d8021047,July 2022,50,Best pizza’s on Amsterdam,Little piece of Italy in middle of Amsterdam. One of best pizza’s what i have ever aeten. Last but not least staff was amazing and very friendly.
d8021047,July 2022,50,10/10,"The ambiance 10/10, food 10/10, really friendly staff (even when it was reaaallly busy). highly recommend to anyone visiting amsterdam, also recommend to book a table in advace!"
d8021047,July 2022,50,Quality kitchen,"I am a regular customer, always happy with the pizza and dessert quality. Quality is not a done deal in all places in Amsterdam Touristic Route, this is an exception on that area."
d8021047,July 2022,50,"Great pizzas, friendly service","We got our table without waiting even thought we didn't have any reservation. But the place is small, so I guess we were just lucky (and eating already at 4:30 PM). The staff had time for some extra conversation and the service was very friendly. The pizzas were great - full of toppings and also looking delicious. We would absolutely recommend the place."
d8021047,June 2022,10,Don’t fall for it,"The place is absolutely miserable: cheap and dirty as it can get. The service is not rude, but it is disinterested. They absolutely don't care what we think. Italian heavy metal and hip hop comes blaring out of the speakers. The day we visited the space was full of cardboard boxes, which prevented customers from passing through. The amount of people who entered and left in horror was enormous. Then the pizzas, are absolutely ordinary, with an extremely greasy top and a dry base, which has nothing to do with the munificent Neapolitan pizza. Avoid this restaurant at all costs."
d8021047,April 2022,50,Awesome Pizza,"Didn't have reservations, so had to wait for a table, but sat next door at the outside tables until we could get in. It was worth the wait. We shared 3 different Pizzas between 4 adults, but it was so good, we ordered a 4th one. The flavor, texture, and ingredients were top notch. It rivaled any Pizza I've had in Italy (and I've been all over Italy over a dozen times). If you like Pizza and are looking for a great place to get some in Amsterdam, this is it."
d8021047,April 2022,30,Overhyped,"Hygiene in this place is awful, the interior is a disaster, too cheap and too cramped up. You need to go through the bar to get to the restrooms. Pizza is nothing too special: not great not terrible, just the usual pizza you kind of expect at such places. Wouldn't come back to this place, I am just not used to eating at places like this."
d8021047,April 2022,50,Pizza Heaven,Went to Amsterdam for 3 nights with the family and on the last day they wanted pizza. Search Tripadvisor for a nearby pizzeria and this one came up.    This is a small place with friendly staff and a decent atmosphere. The pizza is freshly cooked in traditional ovens using ingredients imported from Italy. The pizza tasted as good as it sounds and is first class. I would 100% recommend a visit if you’re looking for Pizza in the centre of Amsterdam.
d8021047,April 2022,50,Mind Blowing...,"Found them via a quick google search for pizza whilst a few blocks away and in desperate need of pizza. Boy am I glad I did. I had the Patate Pizza, having never had potatoes on pizza but feeling adventurous. My friend had the N'duja, having never tasted buffalo cheese but also wanting to try something new. This pizza blew our minds away, or better yet, our taste buds away. Having had delicious pizza in Italy, eaten Lou Malnati's authentic Chicago deep dish, and various amazing pizza's all throughout California (haven't had any in NY yet), I can definitely say this pizza is up there with the best pizzas I have ever eaten in my life.  The service there was also fantastic. We walked in at around 10 pm and got a seat, Ordered, and waited. My friend started not feeling well while we waited so I requested the Pizza to go and they were quick to accommodate. We each decided to taste one slice as we walked back to the hotel... needless to say only half of one pizza actually made it back to the hotel.  Definitely go out of your way to eat here whenever possible! If I lived in Amsterdam this is all I would ever eat."
d8021047,November 2021,50,Perfect pizza,"Really good food. The place is tiny and cosy. Would recomend the pizzas, best pizza i have ever tried in my life. Delicous"
d4703686,November 2022,20,Certainly great cuisine but so overpriced I felt let down,"Located in an off-centre, less touristic neighbourhood and rated high, our expectations were high. However, the white table cloth sets the tone, and I have heard something I had not heard in the 21st centry: 'Each person has to order a main dish (each costing 25+ EUR)'. We have small stomachs and sometimes sharing a main dish is more than enough. We also don't like to waste food. I explained as such but the service person said 'you can take home the rest' - how do we do that as tourists?  The food was carefully prepared and certainly very good, but well, we were no longer in a very jolly mood. Their spices are very mild, dishes are expensive, they serve alcohol. must say for me it is a restaurant targeted at a non-Indonesian population with deep pockets. In addition, the spices stuck on our clothes for some days to come.  Probably a good choice for a special occasion, but it was not for me."
d4703686,October 2022,50,Wow!,"Please put this place on your list! The food, service and atmosphere was wonderful! We enjoyed everything! The food was delicious, the service was warm and friendly and the atmosphere was inviting! It was one of my favorite places in Amsterdam! Thank you!"
d4703686,September 2022,50,Fantastic Indonesian food,"One of the best Indonesian meals you will ever have. Jun the owner is very friendly and has developed a very flavorful menu of ""new era""Indonesian food. Make sure to order many plates not just one main plate. Ask Jun to order for you like I did. Staff and service also good. Location a bit out of the way, but everything in Amsterdam is pretty close if you have a bike."
d4703686,August 2022,40,"Good food, lots of it","Nice meal, very good service. Seemed a bit expensive for rijstafel, but generous portions. Spices had definitely been toned down for European palates."
d4703686,August 2022,50,"Jun can't be overstated, from food to staff to inside atmosphere/decoration, wish I could give more starts","Where to even begin, what an amazing experience! So much more than ''just'' fantastic food! BEST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD    Me and my partner walked to Jun last weekend. No reservations, on a Saturday, we were that silly. We walked in and asked if they had a table free. I could see that they were struggling and wasn't convenient but they worked really hard to accommodate us and eventually the manager got us a seat in less than 5 minutes. In my opinion, this was already incredibly nice. These days restaurants don't try too hard to accommodate unless you have a reservation, which I understand since they are so busy, but when Jun did, was a lovely surprise.  Then, the staff... the manager was fantastic, very smiley, very bubbly, was going around interacting with the tables. It didn't seem fake or forced, I feel like he was genuinely having a blast. The chef was equally sweet, came to greet us, serve us the food, explained how to pair the food with the sauces, he really had love for his dishes. Finally, the waiter, a young gentleman with dark hair and blue eyes (wish I knew the name) was also very pleasant, made sure we were enjoying the food and had everything we needed. Having said this, none of the personnel was suffocating or pretentious like in those fancy restaurants where you actually feel overwhelmed. It was a refreshing mix of fine dining with caring and humble personnel, a great atmosphere.  Last but not least, the food. My god the food! I won't say much besides the fact that was very authentic, very flavourful Indonesian cuisine. The portions were great and we were VERY full when we left. I really liked that they had this set menus and we got to experience all those different flavours. Jun can't be overstated, from food to staff to inside atmosphere/decoration, wish I could give more starts. Genuinely the best experience I've had in a restaurant in a very long time."
d4703686,July 2022,50,"Lovely Indonesian restaurant. If you've never tried Indonesian, it is a must and this is a great place to try it.","One of the best culinary experiences I've had in a while. The food was devine. Every dish ""jinged"" in my mouth. The service was fantastic and very reasonably priced. Even the wine was good, an unusual but well suited selection."
d4703686,July 2022,50,"Not easy to find, but what a find","Our first experience with Rijsttafel, and it was a beaut. Delicious dishes and sauces, and exceptional variety. We recommend heartily, but leave extra time to find it."
d4703686,June 2022,50,Unexpected find,"Always wanted to try authentic Rijsttafel and Jun certainly lived up to my expectations. Just delicious.2 of the highlights were the duck soup and the spring rolls. Had some proteins, veggies, rice, pickled veggies to fill out the meal. Everything cooked perfectly. Especially appreciated the fact that we were running late and had to call twice to let them know that our arrival time kept changing but they still saved us a table. Just a nice dinner. We certainly didnt feel it was over-priced and value ws very good for the quality and amount of food"
d4703686,July 2022,20,Decent food but extremely overpriced,"Food was decent but extremely overpriced. Meals with meat are 32€ per person and up, not under 30€. We ordered the normal rice plate which was 32€ per person (though the website had been misleading so we thought it was going to be 16€ per person and 32€ total), with high expectations considering the price. The quality nor portion matched the price. While the food was decent, we left disappointed. Additionally, the service was rude when we asked for tap water. Considering the price of the food, tap water should be included and not extra in charge."
d4703686,June 2022,40,"Homely Indonesian in ""the suburbs""","We walked from central Amsterdam to this restaurant and had a bit of trouble finding it, without google! It's well run with the owner engaging with patrons, making it feel like you're at his home. The food was tasty and good, not very appetizing to look at, but delicious. Good wine choices."
d4703686,July 2022,50,Delicious!,"Our first time having Indonesian food and we loved it! The rice table was great as we were able to try lots of different things. Delicious food, friendly staff and an all around lovely evening!"
d4703686,March 2022,50,Best Indonesian Food outside of Bali!,"When I did read the reviews on Tripadvisor I got excited about this restaurant. Having experienced authentic Indonesian food by villa cooks in Bali for a view years. I am very happy to report that JUN exceeded my expectations! From the start with a soup that was an explosion of flavors to the dessert, just great!!!"
d4703686,May 2022,50,delightful dinner,"Having a hankering for Indonesian cuisine, we had dinner at Jun.    The restaurant is quite handsome, the service friendly and attentive, and the food very good. It had been awhile since I had tasted Indonesian dishes and the main courses at JUN were spicy than I recall from past experiences in other East Indian eateries.    We asked one of the staff to hail a cab for us. After waiting a few minutes, the manager came out to tell us that the cab had been delayed because ""the bridge was up"", a courtesy we have rarely encountered elsewhere."
d4703686,April 2022,50,"Delicious, authentic rijsttafel; relaxed, stylish atmosphere","We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here last week. Eddie, the owner for over 30 years, is welcoming and gracious, and the staff is equally outstanding. We were waiting for one person in our party to arrive, and the staff was so understanding; no pressure at all for us to hurry. We ordered the ""Ricetable 2"" for three, which has three extra dishes, and that turned out to be plenty for us. Loved the yellow rice!    After the main course, there was just enough room for us to share a few bites of the ""Puding nanas,"" a not overly sweet dessert pudding with fresh pineapple and pomegranate seeds.    One feature we especially appreciated is that the room was quiet even when full of diners, due to the acoustic ceiling tile, and the background music was tasteful and at the appropriate volume.    Highly recommended! Reserve ahead, if possible."
d4703686,April 2022,50,Great food,"The food was good, and the service was lovely! Great with multiple vegetarian options, and not spicy. We had vegetarian rice dish"
d8852649,July 2022,50,Great food and service,"The service and the food were sensational. There were enough options to keep the four of us happy and our bellies full. The service was great, the two staff members were courteous and polite with ever present smiles. The food was filling and fresh. Highly recommend"
d8852649,May 2022,50,Great Pizza,"We were surprised to find a great pizzeria near our hotel. There was a large variety of toppings. The toppings were already prepared, but they allowed us to add other ingredients. The ones we ordered were delicious. We wished that we had had time to return and try more toppings. The employees were friendly, efficient and spoke several languages."
d8852649,April 2022,10,Completely forgotten about and never brought order,"We were seated around 8.40pm as a table of 2. Around 40 minutes passed and we hadn't even had a drinks order taken, so we stopped a waitress who eventually took our drinks order. Another lady walked passed our table and seemed shocked we hadn't had our order taken yet and took our food order. However, as it started to approach 10pm, we still had no food, and we could see the staff clearing up and when we checked online, they were due to close at 10pm. We asked a member of the staff and they had completely forgot our order and told us they were closing.  The whole time there were around 5 members of staff working and about as many tables in the whole restaurant so we aren't sure how we were completely forgotten about throughout. We also only ordered pizza slices so it should not have taken that long to prepare. We ended up having to go to the takeaway across the street, which luckily was delicious."
d8852649,November 2021,20,Okay but expensive,"The pizza is okay, but very expensive and the portions are way too small. Not enough for one person. They do offer a lot of different variations."
d8852649,October 2021,50,Love it,"Every time I’m passing by I have to stop. It is just delicious and one of my favorite places to eat in the city. Fresh, tasty, cool and different flavors and super nice staff."
d8852649,October 2021,50,Nice prices with good quality dishes,"The staff was very friendly, they explained everything on the menu in different languages. The quality of the products and dishes was excellent, the atmosphere was great."
d8852649,July 2020,50,Best pizza in the city!,"Amazing pizza, tbh the best in the entire City. Yes I may have been drunk when eating this but it was still nice"
d8852649,May 2020,30,dating,"is so nice .. to this hotel.. like,a room,bed,rest room..so clean.. so i advace to other for this hotel"
d8852649,April 2020,40,Quite good. Unique shape,Quite good. Unique shape very tasty and great variety. Excellent value for the money. Overall great choice
d8852649,January 2020,40,Tasty Pizzas,"We heard that this was the place to go for Pizza when in Amsterdam and at first I was like wait 4.50 for a slice of pizza, but then I asked to look at the size of the pizza and it was substantial for me, but if your a big eater then this probably isn’t the place for you. It was tasty I had the spicy salami and spicy chicken which I wouldn’t really call it spicy, but tasty."
d8852649,December 2019,50,Delicious different pizza's,"Nice different way of presenting the pizza. I like all the (kind of) square shaped size, instead of the traditional triangle shape. The toppings could be a bit more, but they are tasteful. Sometimes they are more crunchy because of the oven they have, and that makes them even more delicious. Nice dough, good variety. Love it!"
d8852649,November 2019,40,Great quick bites to eat,"We arrived late Monday and wanted some food local to our hotel, and found Sugo. Waitress was pleasant enough and cooked our order. Good doughy pizza. Good choice too, and labelled in English considering it was after 10pm."
d8852649,October 2019,50,Best Pizza ever!!,"If you come to Amsterdam, this place is a must. The pizza is delish and coming from a New Yorker, that’s big. So many varieties!! Fresh ingredients, friendly staff. I never write reviews but felt like this was necessary!!"
d8852649,September 2019,50,Amazing place,"Delicious food and wine, cozy place, very beautiful. Nice place to spent a peaceful evening with friends"
d8852649,September 2019,50,Great place for a quick bite!,"Pizza was delicious and it was nice that you could pick slices from different kinds of pizzas! They just needed to be heated so it was very fast service. Very reasonably priced. Only critique is that the pizza could have used more sauce, it was a bit dry. Other than that definitely recommend for a quick bite of pizza that is better than the chain pizza shops. Also had vegan options"
d2340111,September 2022,20,No worth it T all,For 20 euros a hamburger you expect a better deal but no No restrooms at the place Average hamburger taste You need to wait for a long timeMore
d2340111,August 2022,50,"Tasty burgers, good place to eat!","The burgers were very good and pretty unique, and the chips were good as well with a wide selection of sauces available. It's a nice place to have a quick meal in the city center and not fall into one of the tourist trap restaurants...More"
d2340111,September 2022,50,"Burgers are great, fast and friendly service","We went with a group of six people, we ordered burgers and beers. The manager came to check on us, When he realized that one of us didn't like the burger because it was not fully cooked he immediately arrange for a new one for free. He even brought a waiter who spoke Spanish just to provide a better service. We really liked it. The place is nice, located in the middle of The Pijp neighbourhood in Amsterdam. 100% recommended."
d2340111,September 2022,40,Excellent Burgers,"The food was excellent, we highly recommend the chicken burger. We weren’t sure about choosing it, but it was an incredible option. We would recommend to take out because the only problem was that it gets very busy and there’s no place to sit. But overall it was a Great experience and the staff was very nice."
d2340111,August 2022,40,Mesmerizing vegetarian burger,"Ordered a vegetarian burger consisting of a huge Portobello Burger and double cheddar cheese, it was more than satisfying! Extremely juicy, full of flavors, so tasteful! Keep in mind to add some more mayo in it (unfortunately, they don't put that much on their own).    Nice environment, youthful design, kind of hidden off the central spots, but definitely worth visiting with reasonable prices!"
d2340111,July 2022,30,Bun/burger slightly burned inside,Food is great!!! I would say the best burger in dam ....if they could just pay more attention to don't burn the bun from the inside and the burger either will be great ..for the rest it worth the wait and the money.
d2340111,August 2022,50,Delicious!!!,So delicious. I had the chicken burger... Might be the best burger I've ever had. Highly recommended.
d2340111,July 2022,40,Great burger - but too rare,"Went here with my partner. Burger and chips were very very good BUT on the wall it says burgers are cooked medium well. However, they came out rare. As I'm pregnant, I couldn't eat rare meat. I would have said but I thought it would be medium well. My boyf loved the burger and the chips were excellent. Would absolutely return but specify a well done burger"
d2340111,July 2022,30,"Decent food, nice view, good value for money","Had dinner here with friends! Location is perfect with tables near the canal! Self-service, and quick! Tried the Benedict burger menu, which was tasty but certainly not the best burger I have eaten! Biggest minus was the quality of the meat. Toppings and sauces were tasty! The fries as well!"
d2340111,June 2022,40,It's Amsterdam!,Anybody who goes to Amsterdam knows the food is pretty dire. You're constantly falling into tourist traps and over paying for rubbish. Here the 2 lads were friendly and the burger was adequate. I'd deffo go again just because it's better the devil you know.
d2340111,July 2022,30,Dece burger but my order was wrong,Dece burger but my order was wrong. Also overpriced imo. I asked for mushrooms on my burger and didn’t get them. Also I asked for Coleslaw instead of fries and they said no then didn’t even give me any coleslaw:(
d2340111,June 2022,20,Burgers were just ok,"Burgers were ok but a bit on the greasy side. Overall the restaurant is quite dirty. Didn’t like the staff too much, one tends to be a bit unfriendly"
d2340111,May 2022,50,Amazing burgers,It was worth the experience. Really amazing burgers 🍔 I got the Wagu burger was one of the best I’ve eaten so far. I recommend it definitely 👍🏼♥️
d2340111,March 2022,10,Most rude server I have ever came across,She kept walking off half way through ordering and then getting annoyed when we wE asked for things that they had ran out off when she didn’t tell us previously. She was short with dark hair in a low bun and when my friend left some rubbish on our table she kicked off and said we can’t leave it and said thank you sarcastically. She then snarled and glared at us as we left the shop. DO NOT GO HERE !!!
d2340111,March 2022,50,Best burger in the Dam,This little Gem near the heart of the Dam it's self. Has a huge range of freshly prepared burgers and also vegan. The Irish beef burger was to die for full of juices and the chips was the best I've had in a long time. Very recommended
d8734317,September 2022,50,Extraordinary experience,"The food was very good with extraordinary taste ,made with high quality products .The portions were served very esthetically . The service was very attentive with detailed explanations of the portions ."
d8734317,October 2022,20,So overrated - nice presentation,"from the moment we entered to when we left- a total disappointment. size of the dishes, pricing, service of the waiters. Great Presentation- but we went for a drink right after at the Duchess to compensate"
d8734317,October 2022,50,Amazing flavours and excellent customer service,"We booked an evening meal, and the who experience was a treat. The staff were friendly and explained every dish in detail. The food was outstanding. We had 5 courses, which was ample. There are also pre-courses, and although each helping is modest in size, you come away feeling well-fed. The combination of flavours, textures, and unusual ingredients is delightful."
d8734317,September 2022,50,elegant and inventive cuisine in a lovely setting,"We stopped in for a late lunch, and were lucky to get seated before lunch service closed. The service was perfect, the food was original and exciting. This meal was a highlight of our trip to Amsterdam, and we just happened upon the restaurant while walking back to our hotel. A perfect afternoon!"
d8734317,October 2022,50,Wowser,"What a fabulous cook, attention to detail with a great contrast of flavours that compliment each other. We started off with 3 courses but soon extended to 5, plus all the extras that accompanied the meal.  We visited at dinner time, 2pm (what southerners call luncheon!) and a very nice leisurely time it was.  Knowledgeable waiting on staff that weren't too intrusive, also chef stays in kitchen.  Returning in January to pair the courses with wine.  Fabulous"
d8734317,May 2022,30,Dissapointing.....,"So I struggled with how many stars to rate this restaurant as my party of 4 had such mixed feelings. We chose the 5 servings but explained that one of our party has a nut allergy. This was met with what felt like frustration! It was explained to us that there really wasnt much they could do as nut oil was used in the preparation of the majority of their dishes. This member of our party, who was actually the host, was therefore told he could only be served 3 of the 5 courses. We queried if a different oil could be used as everything was prepared to order and fresh but no. We queried if a serving could be repeated but no this wasnt possible either..... so although the food was pleasant we left rather disappointed and with a still hungry host. Shocked that a restaurant of such quality and cost would be so unhelpful."
d8734317,November 2021,50,Amazing food and drink. Lovely staff,"In terms of food and drink, Breda was outstanding. Probably the best dining experience we had on our trip to Amsterdam. The staff were very knowledgeable and helped pair wines for us. Great time!"
d8734317,September 2022,50,5 stars plus,"The ambiance is lovely…friendly staff, nice decor, not noisy. Tables are well spaced.  We had the 7 course dinner and every course was amazing. We liked it all! The plates were well displayed, the tastes were strong but not overwhelming…everything blended well together. I can’t say enough good things about the entire experience. The food was presented at just the right intervals and our waitress was very knowledgeable about everything we ate."
d8734317,August 2022,50,The best meal we got in Amsterdam,"We went there for our very first lunch in Amsterdam, and we found it so good we thought that maybe, since it does not have a Michelin star, Amsterdam was in a league of its own. Turns out no, it is just this restaurant is excellent. Don’t be put off by its stripped back interior, the fact there is no à la carte menu to choose from or that (at least when we came) there is only one waitress looking after the dining room and the bar. We felt very welcome, well looked after, the wine pairing was spot on and each wine was suitably presented and described. We met the chef who is extremely talented. If I remember correctly he had only been there a few months when we visited, I presume he will acquire a well deserved star soon."
d8734317,July 2022,50,Absolutely outstanding,We had an incredible 3 course meal here. Each course was beautifully presented and packed with flavour. Highly recommend.
d8734317,August 2022,40,surprising surprise diner,great evening - surprising diner - all courses very well balanced - nice location - some work to do with the wine list - we really enjoyed
d8734317,August 2022,50,Absolutely bloody fantastic!,"Oh man this place is so good. I love a surprise menu and not one was a disappointment. Everything perfectly balanced. Their staff are awesome, knowledgeable and friendly. No rush at all. Special mention to Christina. She’s an absolute star."
d8734317,August 2022,50,Excellent all round and Gluten Free not a problem!!!,"Booked for 11th - Michelle.  We treated ourselves to this restaurant after reading the reviews and thinking. ""Sounds great and we don't have to decide what to have it just gets bought out""..(don't worry staff explain what's in each dish, which really adds the the experience). First up; To all Gluten Free peeps.. they can cater for us, just mention when booking and then again as being seated. Bonus is we get pretty much the same menu!! Amaz-balls!!!  Secondly: we are sorry that we did not get our servers name, but she really was excellent.. we went for the 'All we've got' as opposed to 'small selection' or the 'wide selection of dishes' option.(These basically equate to the number of courses you get), along with wine pairing.. what we liked was it wasnt fixed.. so you can decide when to have the next glass, meaning you dont feel obliged to have a glass with every course. It worked out good value for money, plus we learnt a little two.  Now for the best part! The food.... what to say to sum this food up. Honestly, there aren't any words, the menu was excellent, it ranges from a modern European (?) To quirky combinations getting you try things you may never normal choose. For example.. I hate fennel, and anything liquorice... I loved that course!!!  I'm not going to give it away, but if you want to treat someone don't hesitate book and go to Breda.. (don't think you can just rock up, Reservations are a must!!)."
d8734317,August 2022,40,"Excellent food, very slow service","We absolutely loved the food and service was very attentive and friendly. However, the 7-course tasting menu took 3hrs15mins to get through, despite us asking to speed things up as we were very tired. The restaurant was fairly busy, but certainly not full. I am no fan of rushing food, but this took so long it became tedious and really affected our enjoyment, sadly."
d8734317,July 2022,50,Amazing end to our holiday,"We had a 7 course tasting menu with the wine pairing. Atmosphere lively, food excellent, staff friendly and knowledgable. We were not rushed allowed to take our time beween courses and offered a half glass of wine if we wanted, only time this has happened with wine pairing. Shout to Federica our serveur."
d696942,November 2022,50,"Excellent food, service and atmosphere","Excellent food, atmosphere and service. Our hotel concierge recommended this restaurant to us - we were not disappointed!    We both had the 3 course option at 45 euro per person. All of the courses were excellent- we’ve paid a lot more for meals that were nowhere near as good."
d696942,October 2022,50,"Delicious food, great service.","My friend and I visited Hemelse Modder during a stay in Amsterdam and we loved it. Lovely ambience, delicious food and very good, friendly service. Highly recommend if you're in the city."
d696942,October 2022,40,Lovely food at a reasonable price,"We opted for 3 courses for 45 euros. I think that is quite reasonable given the high quality of the food and the portions were a decent size too. I like that you can opt for any combination of courses, so one of us had soup instead of dessert.  There are only a handful of choices for each course but we all found something we liked and agreed the croquettes (starter) were the best!  Recommended."
d696942,September 2022,50,Brilliant Cuisine!,"Great location, beautiful restaurant, friendly service and exquisite, inventive cuisine.  That sums up Hemelse Modder. You can tell the HM crew loves what they do and cheers to them for a lovely dining experience.    What we liked about the meal is that you could choose 3, 4 or 5 courses and pick them from any part of the menu - meaning you could do an appetizer, 2 entrees and one dessert for the 4 course price. While three of the four at our table did the 3 course, one did 4 and the staff timed the courses perfectly. Great wine list and helpful suggestions too!    I went with an all-vegetarian meal and highly impressed - they know how to treat their veg! Others at the table had steak and fish and they all pronounced it delicious.    Highly recommend Hemelse Modder!"
d696942,August 2022,30,Decent food but overpriced and horrible waiter,"The food is decent, but overpriced. The waiter (bald) was arrogant, uninterested and rude. All in all a dissapointment."
d696942,June 2022,50,Best meal in years,This externally modest restaurant gave us the most superb 4 course meal - it was without doubt the best meal we had eaten anywhere since before covid struck in early 2020 - and possibly some years before that. Highly recommend. Booking essential. (NB there is a regular menu and one that changes periodically - the latter on the occasion we visited was entirely vegan and looked to have excellent variety - not just the token vegan dish).
d696942,May 2022,50,"Excellent food, great ambiance and friendly, gracious service.","This is Northern European cuisine utilizing many traditional Dutch ingredients prepared with a French influence. I started with a mackerel tartare with chives lemon dressing, mussels and parsnip chips; the flavors and textures played really well together, a complex symphony of taste that the Japanese describe as Unami. For my main I chose the pan fried rack of lamb with lamb sausage, white wine gravy, marinated radish, turnips greens stew and asparagus - simply divine! My wife had the pan fried Atlantic hake fillet with roasted garlic sauce, antibodies, roasted potato, samphire and fennel - she was pleased. We finished with their signature dark ad white chocolate mousse with vanilla cream - simply marvelous! Prices were very reasonable compared to American restaurants for this quality. Go, just make a reservation and go. The owner-chef and his staff were all very attentive and friendly as well."
d696942,May 2022,30,Food ok but too expensive ! too hectic,"We booked with friends there was a sort of set menu for us but quite expensive, too noisy too many people not far from our hotel double tree hilton nice walk back to the hotel . out hotel was already so noicy and hectic and than again the restaurant so if you like a quite and good dinner don't go there or if you like hectic and noisy that is the place ! Service more or less OK forgot often to fill the glass of some people on the table no idea why !!"
d696942,April 2022,50,Still going strong,"This restaurant opened in 1984 off the beaten track at walking distance from the Nieuwmarkt square. More refined (and more expensive) than it used to be, still worth a visit. Their Hemelse Modder is worthy of winning an award for best dessert. Don't miss !"
d696942,April 2022,50,Sublime Experience in Fantastic Location,"We were staying at the Doubletree Centraal and the Concierge arranged reservations for us when we requested an authentic Dutch neighborhood type experience within walking distance. What a blessing! We've spent much time in Holland and lived in Indonesia for years, so we're consequently quite familiar with much of what is on offer in central Amsterdam. This restaurant is amongst the finest. The service was impeccable, and the kitchen is doing extraordinary work. My wife chose to try the wine pairings for a multicourse meal, all of which was excellent. Each course was unique and delicious, expertly plated. The host is gifted in explaining the wines and the various dishes, providing the hospitality with a smile. Overall, it was a remarkable meal at what turned out to be a very reasonable price. We enthusiastically recommend Hemelse Modder (""Heavenly Mud""), particularly if you are in Centraal and want to walk to dinner."
d696942,March 2022,50,Dinner on a wild night of gales and sleet.,Superb at every level. Friendly professional staff. Extremely efficient service and beautifully presented food. Busy but far from hectic - the atmosphere is testimony to the quality.
d696942,March 2022,40,Nice but noisy,Nice place with good atmosphere. Food was delicious and service was rather quick for a restaurant that looked almost full. Only downside here is the noise level which makes it tough to hear anyone but the person next to you.
d696942,January 2022,40,Lovely cosy restaurant,Very lovely restaurant with good vegetarian and fish dishes! Friendly staff and a good atmosphere. We will visit again!
d696942,September 2021,50,Can’t go wrong,My brother and I still talk about this meal. It always great to be served with people who also have a passion for food. Can’t go wrong here
d696942,October 2021,50,Unbelievable good CHEF!!!,We ordered a 5-dish menu and all of the dishes were absolutely tasty. The dish presentation was excellent. This was our first time at this restaurant and we were delighted. Highly recommended.
d2060174,October 2022,40,Lovely breakfast buffet,We were looking for a good decently priced breakfast and found it here. I went back one day for a quick lunch sandwich and the quality was good and the food fresh.
d2060174,October 2022,10,You had one job…,"IMO this place relies heavily on its location rather than quality of service or food - it surely can’t get any recommendations. Ordering 2 latte macchiatos confused the heck out of staff and we waited 40 mins for two dishes (one was a toastie) because they simply forgot about it. Food was mediocre, but we were so hungry, we ate it all. Very disappointed and was a low point of the trip, but at least we got a lengthy session of people watching in!"
d2060174,August 2022,40,Lovely,"A great welcome, lovely coffee, family atmosphere, very patient and attentive staff. English spoken obviously. Menu includes local and international dishes. A great place for breakfast straight off the train at Amsterdam Centraal"
d2060174,May 2022,50,"Tuesday, May 17th breakfast visit.","We arrived around 9am. It is a tiny place, but we checked in at the front door and let them know that there were 4 of us. They acknowledged us, and we waited outside for a table to clear. We timed it right, and we were inside in short order. There were 2 women working in the restaurant, and they were hustling. We were treated wonderfully, and service was great. I ordered an omelette, along with coffee. I didn’t realize that it was going to be served as a sandwich, but it worked very well. And it was delicious. There are a couple of stand up tables outside too. We really enjoyed our visit. Hats off to the 2 women taking care of us tourists. I would absolutely return."
d2060174,September 2020,50,Great place for breakfast,"Super tasty soy latte, great customer service and community vibe. I would highly recommend this little jewel close to the main train station. Warm, chic and friendly atmosphere."
d2060174,March 2020,10,Rude staff and overpriced food,"After reading the positive reviews my friends and I visited the cafe hoping for a lovely breakfast. Upon arrival we were instructed to sit at the window/bar seats which didn't have enough seats so we sat on the larger table. One of the waitresses was extremely rude and impolite telling us to 'move to the smaller table' saying that she told us 'to move twice' as if we were children. We would have left at that point but we were extremely hungry. Apparently, the large table was for big groups and after we had finished eating no large group had come in...    The food was no better, very average nothing special, the omlette was bland and the place is squashed. Would not reccomend."
d2060174,February 2020,40,Good breakfast at convenient location,We woke up early because of the jet lag. We went out for breakfast and found this place open. We ordered English breakfast and American pancakes. Both are good. Recommended for a good breakfast before going to the station.
d2060174,December 2019,50,BEST BURGER I’VE HAD,"me and my friend popped in for a quick bit to eat in the afternoon. The lady at the till was so well mannered and lovely, couldn’t of asked for better service. I had the best burger I’ve ever had. The sauce on it was unbelievable but unfortunately I can not remember the name of the burger"
d2060174,February 2020,40,🥞,"Try the pancakes they are delicious. A cute little place, good service and really central. Service was good."
d2060174,January 2020,50,Cute little cafe with strong womenspower,Super warm and lovely little cafe. Cool and heartily staff. Good food and coffee. Had a good breakkitime.
d2060174,January 2020,40,Very nice little restaurant.,"Very nice little restaurant. Very small though so you may have to wait for a table. There are a few seats outside also. Service was quite slow as there wasn’t many staff, but food was lovely and good value for money!    We came for brunch and it was lovely."
d2060174,January 2020,50,Great Coffee and Breakfast.,"Great Coffee and Breakfast. Simple, tasty and rather cheap by amsterdam standards. Highly recommended if you have to stop at Amsterdam Centraal."
d2060174,December 2019,20,Not worth it,Not sure why this place is so high in cheap eats list being focused on pancakes and breakfast. Dissapointed both with pancake and sandwiches.
d2060174,November 2019,50,Friendly,Close to central station.Very frienly and good food.Went for a drink Saturday night and back for lunch before going home.The biggest omelette ive ever seen
d2060174,November 2019,50,Cosy little gem,"Cosy, frequently packed, friendly staff and great food. Discovered this on the second day of our trip and frequented this place for breakfast every day for the rest of our break. Highly recommended."
d2690449,November 2022,50,I really enjoyed eating here:),"The first thing I liked was very attentive and friendly staff, who helped us with everything. They also had brochures about India which I found very cool and interesting. And the food itself was just amazing. The menu is really broad, I believe everyone could find exactly what they would want for. I couldn’t recommend this place more:)  P.S. if you come here you should try Lassi Sweet, it was really good and I haven’t seen it in other Indian restaurants."
d2690449,October 2022,50,Simply delicious!,"This was the best Indian meal I have had in a long time. Not as hot as the equivalent dishes in the UK but super-tasty. We had Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Dhansac and Biryani, Naan, rice, raita - all fabulous. The service was also very friendly and professional. Would definitely recommend."
d2690449,October 2022,40,Cosy Restaurant with authentic food,Authentic Indian cuisine in a cozy environment. For sure not a stylish restaurant but the tasty food and the friendly service compensates it all. Would definitely eat here again
d2690449,September 2022,50,Wonderful food and service,"We found this place by accident after a tour at Heineken. And we are so glad we did. The food was delicious, especially their korma dish. Really, really tasty!! The presentation was nice too; we appreciated how the food was kept warm. The service was extremely gracious, as well. Our server was just wonderful (and helped us out with some Amsterdam navigation, as well!) Highly recommend!"
d2690449,September 2022,50,Superb,Simply the best Indian food we’ve ever eaten - and we’ve eaten a lot! Flavours are exquisite. Highly recommend this place.
d2690449,September 2022,50,Really great food and attentive service.,Really great food and attentive service. Picky Indian food eater and this restaurant did not disappoint. Spicy like promised and also accommodating not too spicy for one in our party.👍🏼and good prices.
d2690449,September 2022,50,Best authentic Indian cuisine we have ever had,"Cannot even begin to describe the flavors and the taste of the food that we experienced. Will definitely come again and recommend this to anyone. It was simply amazing. The outdoor dining, the atmosphere, the food, the wait staff,simply everything"
d2690449,August 2022,50,Great lunch,Great lunch ! Enjoyed all the food . The food was of Good quality and comes with nice sides that are a good Compliment To the meal /
d2690449,August 2022,50,My new favorite place in Amsterdam,Chicken tandoori was awesome. Check the daily specials. Really wonderful. Service is great. Wonderful neighborhood. I will be back.
d2690449,August 2022,50,Authentic Indian food in Amsterdam,The serving size was sufficient and the waiters were very friendly and helpful. Indoor and outdoor seating is available
d2690449,July 2022,50,Great food,"Had dinner here, big restaurant great food service a little slow. But the food serving size was large the food quality was good it could of been a bit more spicy, but overall excellent best Indian food I’ve had for a long time."
d2690449,July 2022,40,Indian restaurant,"Good food. They Set up a table for us outside by request. Nice atmosphere, nice people and good food."
d2690449,July 2022,40,Me and my boyfriends,"Me and my boyfriend Anton had a good time at The Taj Indien. Food was good, though we had to wait for it a little while. My other boyfriend Bendik liked a lot too."
d2690449,July 2022,30,Downgraded from 5/5 (Sadly),"In a post covid, supply chain disrupted, inflationary world, its totally understandable that quantity changes… unfortunately I am not as forgiving when it comes to quality. Sadly I’ve seen both decline in these last few months. What I once rated as an inarguable 5/5 now receives a mediocre 3/5..    This after giving it more chances than I should have. Sorry Taj… you’ve dropped the ball."
d2690449,July 2022,50,Stunning India food!,The reviews on here are spot on! While the restaurant doesn’t look amazing from the outside and it isn’t in the greatest location this doesn’t matter once you experience the service and the food both of which are outstanding!    All four of us that eat in the restaurant agreed it was the best curry we had in a long time.    Very much worth escaping the main tourist area to eat here!!!
d2054448,October 2022,50,Lovely dinner,"Excellent food and service, I loved the google gras ! It is the best👌🏻 the wine was great, and the steak was super. I defiantly recommend it!"
d2054448,October 2022,30,"Expensive bistro, little food","It’s located Amsterdam downtown, close to the Central Station. I ate the menu, and it could be been better. The main dish was pork, but it was not well served. Before the main dish, I ate shrimp cocktail, and it was pretty good. The dessert was the best of the night: kind of berry mousse with ice cream. It’s an expensive bistrot, and there are other better options."
d2054448,October 2022,50,Excellent French Food,Excellent food. The entrecot was marvelous. Excellent service. The wine list Excellent. Good atmosphere. Great overall!!!
d2054448,September 2022,50,Great place for wonderful food and wine,Amazing food paired with very nice wine in a great location. We spent their an evening with some colleagues and very much enjoyed it. The waiters were very attentive and supported with great recommendations on food and wine.
d2054448,August 2022,50,Excellent French Bistro,"We dined in Bistrot Neuf twice and on both occasions we had a very enjoyable experience. The service was slick & professional The food, traditionally French was amazing with an excellent wine menu. The It has a cosy, friendly atmosphere. We will definitely be back!"
d2054448,September 2022,20,"Overpriced, food not great.","Over-priced, some of the food quite poor. Service is slick and pushy, not genuine. Setting is cosy but bit pretentious. You'll find waaaay better in Amsterdam."
d2054448,August 2022,50,Fab Restaurant,Amazing find! Outstanding food and service. We were lucky enough to come across this place just by chance and we were lucky to get a table! The food was so delicious - we had the dorado and cannoli for dessert. Extensive wine list too.
d2054448,July 2022,50,Fantastic place!,We dined here twice while visiting in the area. The service is so nice and friendly - the wines are great - very unusual. The food is uniformly excellent. A fantastic place with a real neighborhood feel.
d2054448,July 2022,50,Very great French restaurant in Amsterdam.,"This restaurant is a very special place in Amsterdam. It's a very great culinairy experience for food-lovers. Also the selection of wines is special and great. The atmosphere is cozy and the service is fast and ultimate friendly. We (my sister and I) got served by the owner herself. At the end of the evening our aperitifs we got from the house. We live near Maastricht (with many great restaurants), but when we return to Amsterdam, we surely want to return to this small but very great restaurant.."
d2054448,May 2022,50,A hidden gem.,"My wife and I were in Amsterdam for a long weekend and found the restaurant by chance. What a find. Great food, beautifully cooked and presented and an extensive wine list. Warm professional service as an added bonus."
d2054448,May 2022,50,Can't wait to be back!,"Really tasty food! Everything we've tried was an incredible experience: snails, pate, fish, lamb, ooohhhh desserts were delicious ... Well done Chef!"
d2054448,May 2022,30,"Good food, inflexible menu",We had a lovely dinner in a beautiful setting. I wanted to have the chefs menu but I cannot eat raw meat and veal tartare was the appetizer. We asked the waiter if this could be replaced by anything else but the chef refused. I ended up selecting the bouillabaisse as a main course which was not impressive. This put a damper on what otherwise should have been a great experience. This restaurant is part of the Bib Gourmand recommendation but it needs to work on flexibility. I have been to many BG restaurants that strive to continue their Michelin association by pleasing their clientele.
d2054448,April 2022,30,"Excellent Food, Questionable Service","We really enjoyed the food and ambience at Bistrot Neuf. Our only complaint was our serve was quite unfriendly. Not sure whether it was because we had our children with us; they were pretty well-behaved and aren't that young anyway (14/12/9). Anyway, by the end of the email, we did not really feel welcome at the restaurant, and actually decided to get dessert elsewhere."
d2054448,February 2022,10,Horrible experience,"I went to celebrate valentine day with my girlfriend and they just ruin our day. They presented the complete menu and after we asked for the 4 main course the waitress said there was no time for that (since you only have 1 house and half to eat) and suggest the 3 course, we accepted. They took so long to bring the food that we didn't even have time to eat, they brought the second course 5 minutes before the time expire and they ask us to finish the dinner standing up on the bar. We said we rather have the money back for the last course that we didn't have a chance to eat, so she brought the bill and it was more that the 3 course menu supposed to cost since we had to pay everything separately. Very rude staff, way overpriced and mediocre food. There are many better place in Amsterdam to eat french cuisine"
d2054448,March 2022,50,a nice evening in Amsterdam,"great food, extra advice for the wine and we got some … they had patience with us and allow us to stay in before opening the kitchen - so we had the chance to taste some wines, good ones!"
d1935384,November 2022,50,Best fries in Amsterdam,"Asked a local where to get the best fries and he sent us to Vleminckx. They were so good that we went back the second day. Fresh cut, twice cooked with amazing sauces. He suggests ed #13 which was a type of peanut sauce and onions and it was really good, my friend had curry and loved it and my favourite was a combo of spicy ketchup and Truffle mayo."
d1935384,November 2022,50,"Yes, visit this place!!","Must go when you’re visiting Amsterdam!! Best fries you can get. Oh, and go straight for the medium size - you’ll regret afterwards taking a small portion"
d1935384,October 2022,50,Delicious fries,Delicious fries. Long line but it moved very quickly - they are very efficient. Lots of different sauces to choose from. Friendly staff.
d1935384,July 2022,40,Great if you need a snack,This is a bit of a novelty but the chips and topping are very good and the service is quick so don't be put off by the line.
d1935384,September 2022,40,Nothing too special,Not a bad place for fries but a bit overrated. These fries are fried longer than what you may be used to and they resemble kettle chips more than fries.
d1935384,June 2022,50,"Good fries for a snack, for a strolling break","At the end these are chips, but they're so good, and the variety of sauces is magnificent. Really good for sharing or for solo, before your next walking..."
d1935384,September 2022,40,"Nice fries, but not amazing!","We visited her at 11.40am and there were only 2 people in the queue, so we got served really quickly. I ordered the medium fries and my husband got the large. The large didn’t seem that big tbh and certainly not that much bigger than the medium. The fries were nice and crispy, but not amazing and there were quite a lot of ends in the bottom of the cone. The sauce was amazing though. I got the curry and it was like a sweet curry sauce. My husband got ketchup and melted cheese and he enjoyed this too. This is meant to be one of the best in Amsterdam. I’d like to compare it to others next time I visit!"
d1935384,August 2022,50,So crunchy!,"Such a a good fries! Fresh, so crunchy, good sauces and affordable prices. Also got my order really fast."
d1935384,May 2022,50,Historical fries shop,"Historical and cool fries shop in the city centre. A must visit for a fast snack, maybe a replacement for a quick meal if you are in a rush (at least it works for me :P ). They only serve fries but have a number of sauces. Fast service, don't mind the line ! Fully worth a stop."
d1935384,March 2022,50,Best fries in town,"The Best fries in the town!!! Always with a queue (that’s a good indication that something good it’s happening), fries always made at the moment, awesome sauce."
d1935384,March 2022,40,Very good fries,Very good chips right around the corner from a few coffee shops so perfect for those munchies !! Friendly staff countless sauces and options we went for the spicy ketchup with truffle mayo topped with fresh onions - banging !!! Cheap  Enough as well around 8 euro for a large cone of fries
d1935384,November 2021,50,Fantastic Fries bij Vleminckx,"Staff works fast and are friendly. I can recommend number 13 (the war it is peanut sauce, fritessauce and onions) typical Dutch. It was amazing. Can recommend Vleminckx till everyone. Until the next time 🙂"
d1935384,September 2021,10,My last time here,"I have had my fries here very often. And an end has come to me going here. It is not the wait in line. It is the quality, that seems to dive as low as the line is long. People, there are much better fries in town. My bag was full of hard pieces of potato, and that was not the first time. This place was excellent but is now part of the mediocre tourist bunch of fries places. Which I find sad."
d1935384,August 2021,50,The best fries in town,Quick service for when you are not that hungry. Crunchy and fresh fries. The truffle mayo is absolutely divine Would recommend 100%
d1935384,February 2021,50,Fantastic. Very well deserved,"Fantastic. Very well deserved reviews. Awesome fries, great mayonnaise and excellent value for the money"
